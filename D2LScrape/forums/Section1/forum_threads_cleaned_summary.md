### Response 2 (Laryssa Hartmann):
This is a great overview of the potential fire risks in the operating room and the strategies to minimize those risks. As you pointed out, the key components for fire-fuel, ignition and oxidizer- are often present together in the OR, making fire prevention a critical aspect of surgical safety. However, it’s important to emphasize that fire prevention alone isn’t enough, its equally crucial that every member of the OR team understands their role in responding effectively to a “Code Red” fire emergency
 
In response to your post, I’d like to highlight the importance of comprehensive training for all OR staff, ensuring they are prepared to act quickly and efficiently if a fire occurs. In the event of a fire, prompt and coordinated action can significantly reduce the severity of the situation. For example, surgeons and technicians need to be aware of the flammability of solutions and keep ignition sources, such as lasers, at a safe distance from oxygen or combustible materials (Rinder, 2008). If a fire does occur, immediate response by the entire team is essential to prevent further escalation. By ensuring all team members know the critical role they play in both preventing and managing an OR fire, we can help protect patients and minimize risks (Rinder, 2008). Regular fire drills, clear protocols, and a well-rehearsed “Code Red” system can be the difference between a incident and a catastrophic event.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Great input on operating room fires.
I agree with Laryssa that regular fire drills are essential, but unfortunately, fire safety is not always at the top of the priority lists in the operating rooms. A study found that members of the anesthesiology and surgical departments are not commonly actively involved in fire drills or simulations (Hart et al., 2011). I wish this could be changed since the operating rooms readily contain the fire triangle, all three components essential to creating a fire. 
Greg shared an excellent algorithm for the management of operating room fires. I want to add some points on preventing and managing an airway fire that may happen during a laser ENT surgery. As prevention, we can moisten gauze or other potential fuel sources near the laser. As Greg mentioned, we would try to limit oxygen to 30% or less and avoid using N2O to decrease the chance of fire after the laser burst. More importantly, we should use laser endotracheal tubes. Initially, fires stay on the surface of the tube and could cause thermal injury to upper airway tissues. However, if the fire burns through the tube, positive pressure ventilation could blow heat and toxic chemicals into the lungs. Laser endotracheal tubes resist laser (except the cuff) and help prevent more severe damage. This also reiterates the importance of disconnecting the patient from the breathing circuit and extubating right away, as indicated in the algorithm.

# Question 10

**Question:** Question 10: Describe the channeling effect of carbon dioxide absorbents and its impact.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3869/View)

### Response 1 (Junia Isaac):
The channeling effect in CO₂ absorbents refers to the formation of preferential pathways, or "channels," within the absorbent material where gas flows with minimal resistance, bypassing a substantial portion of the absorbent granules. This phenomenon undermines the efficiency of CO₂ removal during inhalation anesthesia and arises due to multiple contributing factors. The issue has been recognized for nearly a century, as Dr. Waters first highlighted the importance of effective carbon dioxide filtration in early inhalation anesthesia systems (Waters, 1924; Waters, 1926). He observed that poor gas distribution across the absorbent bed—often caused by improper packing—led to inefficiencies that remain relevant today (Waters, 1924).
** **
**How Channeling Occurs**

- Improper Packing: when the absorbent is loosely or unevenly packed, gaps form between granules. These gaps provide low-resistance pathways, allowing exhaled gas to flow through the channels instead of being uniformly exposed to the absorbent. This issue was noted in early anesthesia practices by Waters (1924; 1926) and remains a critical factor in modern anesthesia systems.
- Settling of Granules: vibrations during use or improper handling can cause absorbent granules to shift and settle, especially in inadequately filled canisters. Over time, this can exacerbate the formation of channels and uneven flow distribution (Feldman et al., 2021).
- Granule Size and Shape: absorbents with irregularly shaped or larger granules are more prone to creating open spaces between particles, increasing the risk of channeling. Using absorbents with finer, more uniform granules can mitigate this issue (Feldman et al., 2021). For example, innovations like Amsorb – a modern absorbent introduced by Murray et al. (1999) – use uniform granule sizes to reduce uneven gas flow and ensure consistent CO₂ absorption across the canister.

**Impact of the Channeling Effect**

- Inefficient CO₂ Absorption: as gas bypasses the bulk of the absorbent, CO₂ removal becomes suboptimal. This can result in inadequate scrubbing of exhaled gas, leading to higher CO₂ levels in the inspiratory mix.
- Hypercapnia Risk: the failure to effectively remove CO₂ may cause hypercapnia in patients. Elevated CO₂ levels can lead to respiratory acidosis, with symptoms including increased respiratory rate, tachycardia, and potential cardiovascular compromise (Feldman et al., 2021; Walker et al., 2021). 
- Uneven Absorbent Usage: channeling causes some areas of the absorbent to deplete rapidly while leaving other regions virtually unused. This not only wastes absorbent material but also necessitates more frequent canister replacements, increasing costs and environmental impact (Zhong et al., 2020).
- Chemical Interactions: poor distribution caused by channeling can also increase the potential for exothermic reactions between volatile anesthetics and the absorbent material, posing safety concerns and reducing overall efficiency (Baum & Woehlck, 2003).

**Prevention of Channeling**

- Uniform Filling and Packing: ensuring that the absorbent is packed evenly and without gaps can significantly reduce the likelihood of channeling. Following manufacturer guidelines for filling and maintaining canisters is critical for optimal performance.
- Regular Maintenance: periodic inspection and replacement of the absorbent material are essential to prevent settling and the associated channeling effect.
- Innovative Canister Designs: modern anesthesia machines incorporate features like baffle systems or flow distribution mechanisms that promote even gas distribution across the absorbent bed, minimizing the risk of channeling (Feldman et al., 2021). Furthermore, advances in absorbent technology, such as Amsorb, have introduced chemical properties and granule uniformity to improve performance and mitigate channeling risks (Murray et al., 1999).

 
The channeling effect not only reduces the efficacy of CO₂ removal but also compromises patient safety by increasing the risk of hypercapnia. By understanding its causes and implementing measures to prevent it, clinicians can maintain safe and effective anesthesia practices. Additionally, attention to absorbent design and gas flow interactions can further enhance the safety and efficiency of anesthesia systems (Baum & Woehlck, 2003).

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Junia, for a very clear and thorough post on the channeling effect.
A follow-up question for everyone: if you suspect that channeling is happening in the middle of an intubated and ventilated case, what would you do?
As Junia mentioned channeling can cause prematurely exhausted CO2 absorbent, which will lead to hypercapnia. I think this is a great opportunity for everyone to review about hypercapnia. What are other mechanical causes for hypercapnia (i.e. anesthesia gas machine issues)? 
Also, what are other clinical signs of hypercapnia? How could you recognize that your intubated and ventilated patient has hypercapnia?
:::
### Response 3 (Adrian Harris):
Hi Junia and Phoebe! Thanks for sharing with us about this important effect on the carbon dioxide (CO2) absorbents.  For me personally, this is the first time I’d heard of channeling and I’m glad to be now aware of it. 
 
As you’ve discussed, exhausted CO2 absorbent, whether caused by channeling or not, can cause rebreathing of CO2 in the patient.  This will be evident on capnography with a gradually increasing end-tidal CO2 baseline as show in Figure 1 below. 
 

Figure 1. Capnography of rebreathing due to exhausted CO2 absorbent (1)
 
This can be corrected by replacing the CO2 absorbent with a new canister at a safe point during the case and confirming CO2 levels have returned to a baseline of 0 (2)
 

Some other mechanical causes of hypercapnia:
 

- Incompetent inspiratory valve (stuck open) – exhaled patient gases can mix with inspiratory gas flow causing increasing CO2 baseline seen below in red in Figure 2 (2)

 

Figure 2. Capnography of rebreathing due to malfunctioning inspiratory valve (1)
 

- Incompetent expiratory valve – both increased inhaled and exhaled CO2 should appear as in Figure 3 (2)

 

Figure 3. Capnography of rebreathing due to malfunctioning expiratory valve (1)

 
Other less likely mechanical causes of hypercapnia: 

- Artifact in the capnograph due to moisture/water in the sampling line or a sampling rate that is too low
- Inadvertently administering carbon dioxide gas (2)

 
If incompetent unidirectional valves are suspected:
 

- Increase the fresh gas flow to be greater than the patient’s minute ventilation (3)
- If the CO2 remains high despite high fresh gas flow, you should suspect an incompetent valve 
- Call for help, manually ventilate the patient on 100% O2 from an oxygen tank, maintain anesthetic depth with total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) and change the breathing block or the anesthesia gas machine (3)

 
Clinical signs of hypercapnia in the patient:

- Increased FiCO2 on anesthetic monitor
- Hypertension 
- Tachycardia 
- Increased bleeding at surgical site
- Dysrhythmias 
- Flushed, sweaty skin (3)
- Hypoxemia (during the late stages of hypercapnia) (4)

 
Hypercapnia due to rebreathing can be addressed by corrected the root cause and/or increasing the patient's minute ventilation on the ventilator (3)

# Question 11

**Question:** Question 11: You smell Sevoflurane during a case. What may be the cause, and how would you troubleshoot?

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3868/View)

### Response 1 (Janelyne Mandegarian):
Question 11: You smell Sevoflurane during a case. What may be the cause, and how would you troubleshoot? 
 
If you are suspecting an anesthesia gas leak during a case you would smell a very sweet, non-pungent and non irritating smell, which is abnormal. Gas leaks can be harmful to both the patient and those in the operating room environment. If detected it must be dealt with immediately. Have a resuscitation bag readily available if troubleshooting is longer and difficult to pinpoint and get assistance.
For the patient hypoxia, hypoventilation and improper delivery of anesthesia agents and gases can arise for the patient (Kishimoto et al., 2021). According to the Canadian Center for Occupational Heath and Safety (2024) healthcare workers in the room exposed can have headache, nausea, fatigue, dizziness, difficulties with judgement and coordination. With severe and prolonged exposure can cause reproductive issues (sterility and miscarriages and birth defects) and possibly liver and kidney disease.
Starting from the patient ensuring the mask fit is proper and not ill fitted as it can escape around it (Dorsh & Tharp, 2024). Next ensure endotracheal tube cuff is sufficiently inflated and no tears or punctures along the shaft, hence the importance to inflating and deflating cuff prior to intubation. Also, confirm LMA is properly sized for the patient. Pediatric uncuffed ETT has potential to leak if not properly sized, uncuffed ETT tube should sit well if properly sized due to the narrow trachea (Butterworth et al., 2018).
Moving to the breathing circuit, confirm ETT tube in connected securely to the right angle connector and not open. If hissing is heard or visibly see a break or hole in the corrugated tubing it should be replaced immediately. Another possibility of a gas leak is the end tidal sampling line is not closed and leaking through the port, so securely affixing it corrects it. Also, the inspiratory limb may not be connected at the machine which may cause the leak of the anesthetic gases. C02 absorber should properly slotted as misposition can cause gas leaks and is common. Applying a soapy solution to the connection will cause bubbling indicating a leak (Butterworth et al., 2018).
Common leak problems on the vaporizers or vaporizer interface where either there is a spill from improper filling or overfilling or cap is not properly fastened. Ensure keyed filling devices seals are established and properly closed as it will leave the port open which allows significant leakage (Dorsch & Dorsch, 2008). Spills can be quickly sopped up by damp cloth and disposing appropriately, not using any cleaners around the port of the vaporizer to prevent contamination. Check position of the vaporizer and it is properly set into position and not tipped and assure proper attachment to the machine. Mechanical failure can cause gas leak and should be checked daily with the low-pressure system check daily (Weston, 2023). If the vaporizer is leaking, you may have the reservoir bag under filling and can determine that the leak probably is from the vaporizer but there may be a disconnect of the bag itself so properly attaching back can repair it.
Check the scavenging system, the vacuum may be set to low and the WAG exiting the AGM may exceed the capacity of the scavenging collecting bag. As is get too distended the positive pressure will cause the relief valve to open and release WAG into the operating room (Palmer, D., 2019).

### Response 2 (Junia Isaac):
Thank you for such a comprehensive and thoughtful discussion on the potential causes and troubleshooting of anesthetic gas leaks during a case. You’ve done an excellent job outlining various contributing factors and practical steps for identifying and addressing leaks. I appreciate how you tied in potential risks not only for patients but also for healthcare providers in the operating room, especially citing the Canadian Center for Occupational Health and Safety (2024) regarding long-term health effects of anesthetic gas exposure.
Building on your discussion, another potential contributor to anesthetic gas leaks can be found in the seals of the gas sampling line or at the connections to the gas analyzer. Leaks in the anesthesia machine’s gas delivery system, including sampling lines and gas analyzer connections, are common culprits that can go unnoticed without thorough pre-use testing (Palmer, 2019). Regular maintenance and inspection of gas analyzer components are crucial to ensure proper function and safety, as these areas may be overlooked during routine troubleshooting (Dorsch & Dorsch, 2008). Incorporating these checks into daily protocols can prevent undetected leaks that could compromise monitoring accuracy and patient safety.
 
Additionally, the placement and integrity of ventilator bellows in older anesthesia machines can also lead to leaks if they become damaged or misaligned. Ensuring proper alignment and verifying tight seals around bellow casings is critical for maintaining the efficiency of the gas delivery system (Weston, 2023). Neglecting these components during equipment checks could lead to inefficiencies or potential patient harm. Butterworth et al. (2013) also emphasize the importance of incorporating systematic checks for such components into regular equipment maintenance to reduce the risk of leaks and operational disruptions.
 
Given the risks associated with prolonged exposure to waste anesthetic gases for healthcare workers, do you think modern scavenging systems adequately address these concerns? Are there newer technologies or practices that could further reduce occupational exposure in the operating room? Kishimoto et al. (2021) demonstrated that equipment misuse, such as improper tube holder placement, could also result in leaks, further emphasizing the need for attention to detail during setup. Exploring advancements in scavenging systems or monitoring technology could mitigate such risks effectively.
 
Overall, your post has provided a fantastic framework for understanding and addressing anesthetic gas leaks.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Janey and Junia, for sharing the possible causes of the inhaled anesthetic leak. I also appreciate Janey’s systematic troubleshooting approach, starting from one end to the other. I, too, prefer to begin with the patient and then work through the rest of the machine.
I completely agree with Janey that any gas smell during a case must be addressed immediately. The threshold for detecting volatile agents by smell is estimated to be greater than 5 ppm, which exceeds the recommended levels of less than 2 ppm.
I want to dive deeper into checking the scavenging system. First, we must ensure the indicator float is between the lines. With a closed, active system, hearing a hissing sound means trouble. It indicates that waste gas is escaping into the room, likely due to an insufficient vacuum, which causes the waste gas to escape through the positive pressure relief, as Janey mentioned. Conversely, hearing a hissing sound with an open, active system indicates that the vacuum is functioning properly. It is when we do not hear any hissing that we need to be concerned, as it indicates there is no vacuum. With an open interface without a vacuum, waste gases are free to escape as the interface is open to the atmosphere.

# Question 12

**Question:** Question 12: The patient is intubated and ventilated. The high peak inspiratory pressure suddenly alarms. What equipment issues may cause this, and how would you troubleshoot?

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3867/View)

### Response 1 (Tenzing Choedar):
The patient is intubated and ventilated. The high peak inspiratory pressure suddenly alarms. What equipment issues may cause this, and how would you troubleshoot?
 
High peak inspiratory pressure (HPIP) alarms on an anesthesia gas machine are triggered when the peak inspiratory pressure exceeds a predefined threshold. This threshold is typically set by the user, usually 10 to 15cm H2O above the usual peak inspiratory pressure, but often defaults to +40 cm H₂O, depending on the pressure monitor design (Eisenkraft & Jaffe, 2021). It is one of the most common alarms encountered during mechanical ventilation. If not promptly addressed, elevated peak pressures can result in both barotrauma, volutrauma and cardiovascular compromise. Prolonged barotrauma may lead to complications such as pneumothorax and pneumomediastinum, while volutrauma involves lung tissue damage caused by overinflation (Covert & Niu, 2015; Eisenkraft & Jaffe, 2021). Therefore, it is imperative to recognize the serious implications this alarm may have on the patient’s condition and to initiate prompt and systematic troubleshooting to mitigate potential harm. 
 
To effectively troubleshoot HPIP alarm, it is important to understand inflation pressures and the underlying principles of lung compliance and resistance. Lung compliance refers to the ability of the lungs to expand, influenced by the elastic properties of both the lungs and the chest wall. Lung resistance, on the other hand, represents the opposition to airflow through the respiratory system. This resistance includes not only the airways within the lungs but also external factors such as the endotracheal tube (ETT) and the connected breathing circuit. Peak inspiratory pressure (PIP) reflects the sum of pressures needed to overcome airway resistance and lung compliance. An inspiratory hold maneuver (0.5–1 second pause) measures inspiratory plateau pressure (Pplat), a static pressure independent of airway resistance, which best estimates alveolar pressure and correlates with lung tissue stress (Figure 1.).
Important to note: 

- Elevated PIP and Pplat: Indicates decreased lung compliance.
- Elevated PIP only: Indicates increased airway resistance.
- Pplat should generally remain ≤30 cm H₂O to minimize alveolar damage (Covert & Niu, 2015).

 
When high peak inspiratory pressure suddenly alarms, the differential is broad, think “patient vs machine”. 
 

Patient Factors

Equipment Factors 

Low compliance: 

- Coughing or bucking 
- Surgical peritoneal insufflation 
- Intentional single lung ventilation
- Mainstem intubation
- Pulmonary edema
- Pneumothorax, especially tension. 

High resistance: 

- Bronchospasm
- Laryngospasm
- Airway obstruction by mucous plug, blood or foreign body. 

Endotracheal tube: 

- Kinked or obstructed endotracheal tube
- Tube displacement/migration into mainstem

Circuit or gas machine: 

- Increased delivered tidal volume
- High fresh gas flow rate with uncompensated ventilator
- Oxygen flush on during inspiration
- Breath-stacking due to inadequate expiratory time
- Obstructed breathing circuit at inspiratory hose or stuck valve (inspiratory/expiratory/APL)
- Pooling of condensed water vapor in circuit
- Wet filters causing increased resistance
- Improperly placed equipment such as PEEP valve or humidifier
- Kinked/misconnected hose in circuit/scavenge limb

(Eisenkraft & Jaffe, 2021; Loeb, 2024)

 
Approach to troubleshoot: 
 
Check patient first. Assess whether patient is hemodynamically stable or unstable. 

- If there is any threat to airway, breathing, or circulation (ABC), the first step is to disconnect the patient from the ventilator and initiate manual ventilation using high-flow oxygen or by switching to the manual (bag) mode and releasing pressure by opening the APL valve.
- Simultaneously, perform a quick visual check to determine if the ETT has shifted, which may indicate tube dislodgement. If a rush of air is heard upon disconnecting the ventilator and the patient regains hemodynamic stability within a few seconds, auto-PEEP is the most likely cause.

Preventing the recurrence of auto-PEEP may require increasing sedation or administering a paralytic.

- If the issue persists after disconnecting the ventilator, hand-ventilate and assess bag resistance and chest rise. Resistance and asymmetric chest rise with absent breath sounds and hypoxia suggest pneumothorax. For tension pneumothorax (unilateral decreased breath sounds, hypotension, tracheal deviation), perform immediate needle decompression without further diagnostics.
- If bilateral breath sounds are present and tension physiology is not suspected, attempt to pass a suction catheter. Difficulty or inability to pass the catheter suggests a kinked ETT. If the catheter passes, suction the patient; restored hemodynamic stability indicates a likely mucus plug.
- If the patient is hemodynamically stable, check the plateau pressure. Elevated peak pressures without a corresponding rise in plateau pressure suggest increased airway resistance, which may be caused by airway obstruction, bronchospasm, secretions, plugging, high inspiratory flow rate, coughing, or ETT biting.
- Elevated peak and plateau pressures indicate reduced compliance, which can be due to either decreased chest wall or lung compliance. Chest wall compliance is impaired by conditions like circumferential burns, flail chest, and malignant hyperthermia. Lung compliance decreases in conditions such as pulmonary edema, ARDS, pulmonary fibrosis, abdominal distention, pneumothorax, atelectasis, and right mainstem intubation (Covert & Niu, 2015).

If patient-related factors are ruled out, the focus should shift to evaluating potential equipment malfunctions.

- Check oxygen flush valve and fresh gas flow rates. 
- Locate the site of circuit obstruction.

Obstructions within the patient or ETT tend to cause high peak airway pressure but normal PEEP. 
Obstructions on the inspiratory side of the breathing circuit tend to cause low peak airway pressure. 
Obstructions on the expiratory side of the breathing circuit or scavenger system tend to cause high peak and PEEP. 

Potential issues with breathing circuits can arise from various causes. Incorrectly connected tubes can disrupt gas flow and cause malfunction, while improperly placed humidifiers or unidirectional PEEP valves can obstruct airflow if not positioned correctly. External crimping of the circuit, such as pinched tubing, can reduce or block airflow. Internal obstructions, like mucous plugs or water, may also create blockages. If plastic wrapping or caps are left on CO2 absorbent, they prevent proper function. Some machines include a rubber stopper as part of an automated check, but if left in place, it can block gas flow. Additionally, stuck inspiratory or expiratory valves can interfere with proper breath cycling. Any of these issues should be promptly addressed to restore proper ventilation and function. Pay special attention to any component that may have been changed or adjusted since the anesthesia machine pre-use check.
 
When assessing the scavenger system, it's important to check for potential obstructions that can disrupt its function:

- **Disconnected scavenger system**: If the scavenger system is not connected to the waste anesthesia gas outlet, it cannot remove waste gases properly.
- **External crimping of the hose**: Pinching or kinking the hose between the breathing circuit and scavenger system can obstruct gas flow.
- **Internal obstruction of the hose**: Blockages inside the hose can also restrict the movement of gases.
- **Failure of the APL valve**: The Adjustable Pressure-Limiting (APL) valve, which directs waste gases into the scavenger system, can fail, preventing proper waste gas evacuation.
- **Failure of the ventilator relief valve**: This valve allows excess pressure to escape to the scavenger system; if it fails, it can lead to improper waste gas management.
- **Failed overpressurization valve**: This valve protects the scavenger system by venting waste gases when pressures are too high. If it fails, the scavenger system cannot vent excess gases, and when the flow from the breathing circuit exceeds the vacuum flow rate, the system will back up, leading to high peak and PEEP circuit pressures. This issue worsens with increased fresh gas flow.

These problems can prevent proper waste gas removal and lead to higher pressures in the breathing circuit, which can complicate patient ventilation. Identifying and correcting these issues is critical to ensure proper scavenging function (Luria & Loeb, 2023). Figure 2 presents a flowchart outlining the steps for evaluating and addressing high peak inspiratory pressure.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Hi Tenzing,
Thanks for such a detailed post on troubleshooting high peak airway pressure.
I especially like your systemic approach to checking the patient and then the airway. Adding onto your patient factors, patient positioning can be another factor. For example, the Trendelenburg position can increase intra-abdominal pressure and reduce lung compliance, especially in obese patients or with excessive insufflation of the abdomen. Prone position can also increase airway pressures due to changes in chest wall mechanics. Lateral decubitus position can cause uneven distribution of ventilation, potentially increasing airway pressures. 
In anesthesia, we often diagnose (rule out) and treat at the same time. Regardless of the cause of the high peak airway pressure, I would increase FiO2 to 100% and check capnography to confirm adequate gas exchange. Then, as you suggested, I will quickly switch to “Bag mode” manual ventilation to assess pulmonary and breathing circuit compliance. Next is to auscultate for symmetry of breath sounds, wheezes, or crackles. Equal bilateral air entry helps us rule out endobronchial intubation and pneumothorax. If there are wheezes, we can consider bronchospasm and treat it with puffers. If there are crackles, we can consider secretions or pulmonary edema. As you suggested, I would also pass a suction catheter to suction any secretions and rule out tube obstruction.

# Question 13

**Question:** Question 13: A patient who has a family history of malignant hyperthermia is brought into the operating room for an elective case. Discuss your approach in preparing the anesthesia gas machine so that it is safe to use on this patient.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3866/View)

### Response 1 (Deena Kurilsky):
**Question #13: A patient who has a family history of malignant hyperthermia is brought into the **operating room **for an elective case. Discuss your approach in preparing the anesthesia gas machine so that it is safe to use on this patient. **
 
**What is malignant hyperthermia (MH):**

- A hypermetabolic state that is triggered by volatile anesthetic gases and succinylcholine
- The disorder results in an uncontrolled release of calcium from the skeletal muscle and sustained muscle contraction, muscle rigidity, hypermetabolism and severe hyperthermia
- Symptoms present as an unexplained increase in end-tidal CO2, increase in temperature, tachycardia, lactic acidosis, hyperkalemia and rhabdomyolysis (Cook & Hemmings, 2023).

 
Proper preparation of the anesthetic machine is essential to prevent any complications. Often the MH patient is booked as the first case of the day. It is important to know your specific hospital policy, as there can be slight variations in preparing the gas machine.
 

- Remove all vaporizers from the anesthesia gas machine to prevent accidental use and remove succinylcholine from the medication cart

 

- **Option 1**: Remove ventilator block and replace it with a MH designated block only used for MH confirmed or suspected cases. 
- Remove all equipment that may have come into contact with volatile anesthetics including single use mask, breathing circuit, CO2 sampling line and water filters, CO2 absorbent and breathing bag
- If ventilator block has been replaced, perform the anesthesia machine self-test, followed by flushing the anesthetic machine for 15 minutes. To flush the system, attach an extra reservoir bag to the end of the circuit that would typically attach to the endotracheal tube. From the ventilator screen start the manual/spontaneous mode of ventilation. Confirm there is fresh gas flow of 18lpm and FiO2 1.0, the high fresh gas flow will clear any residual anesthetic in the system. Next change to volume control mode and allow the system to run for 15 minutes (Mount Sinai Hospital, 2018).

 

- **Option 2:** Use of the vapor-clean charcoal filter. As per manufacturer instructions once the anesthetic vapor is shut off and the machine has been flushed with fresh gas flow > 10L for at least 90 seconds the charcoal filter can be placed on the inspiratory and expiratory limb of the circuit. Remove all equipment that may have come into contact with volatile anesthetic as indicated above and maintain a fresh gas flow >3L/min throughout the case. The use of the vapor-clean filter streamlines and decreases time to use if used by your facility (Dynasthetics, 2024).

 

- Ensure the MH cart is outside of the room throughout the case and follows the patient to the post anesthesia care unit (PACU) (Mount Sinai Hospital, 2018).

### Response 2 (Janet Rozek):
**Great review of the important key things to prepare with a known MH case!** I thought I would review what exactly is recommended to belong in an MH cart, which is usually located in a defined space and readily accessible to any OR that may encounter an MH emergency.
What is Typically in an MH Cart:
A Malignant Hyperthermia (MH) cart is specially equipped to handle an MH crisis quickly and effectively. Here are the typical contents of an MH cart:
Medications:

- 
**Dantrolene:** The primary drug used to treat MH, available in vials (Dantrium is what is used in my facility). It’s important to know how many vials are available immediately or if the pharmacy needs to be called ASAP for more stock.

36 vials should be available in each institution where MH can occur, each vial to be diluted at the time of use with 60 ml of sterile water.

- 
**Sterile Water for Injection:** (Without a bacteriostatic agent) Used to reconstitute dantrolene.

- 
**Sodium Bicarbonate (8.4%):** To manage acidosis – 50 ml x 4.

- 
**Dextrose (50%):** To manage hypoglycemia – 50 ml vials x 2.

- 
**Calcium Chloride (10%):** To manage hypocalcemia – 10 ml vial x 2.

- 
**Regular Insulin (100 units/mL):** Will be refrigerated.

- 
**Lidocaine (2%):** For ACLS protocol preparation.

- 
**Refrigerated Cold Saline Solution:** Minimum 3,000 ml for IV cooling.

Equipment:

- 
**IV Supplies:** Needles, syringes, IV catheters, and infusion pumps.

Syringes: 60 ml x 5 to dilute Dantrium.

- 
**Suction Apparatus:** To clear the airway if necessary.

- 
**Cooling Devices:** Ice packs or cooling blankets to manage hyperthermia.

- 
**Monitoring Equipment:** To continuously monitor the patient's vital signs.

Esophageal temperature probe (or other core temp probes).

CVP kits.

Rapid wound closure drapes.

Urine meters.

Large plastic bags for ice.

Buckets for ice.

- 
**Activated Charcoal Filters:** To reduce the risk of anesthetic gas exposure.

- 
**Emergency Contact Information:** For quick access to the MH hotline and other relevant contacts.

Laboratory Testing Supplies:

- 
**Syringes (3 ml)** for blood gas analysis or ABG kits x 6 or point-of-care monitors.

- 
**Blood Specimen Tubes** for CK, myoglobin, SMA 19 (LDH, electrolytes, thyroid studies), PT/PTT, fibrinogen, fibrin split products; and lactate, CBC, platelets.

- 
**Urine Collection Container** for myoglobin level.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Deena, for reviewing your institution's protocol for malignant hyperthermia (MH) setup.  Also, Janet, thanks for reviewing the contents of the MH cart
We also follow a similar protocol to your Option 1 at University Health Network. Once we remove the vaporizer, we usually place a piece of tape over the vaporizer slot.
An important note is about the tear-down afterward. Especially for those institutions that utilize a dedicated MH component, it is crucial to ask the operating room to notify us when the surgery is finished, so that we can replace the machine with the conventional parts. The last thing we want is to start a new regular case with the MH-designated parts and contaminate them. Similarly, if the charcoal filters are used during the MH case, we have to make sure that they are removed for the regular case. If not, we will not be able to deliver inhaled anesthetics to induce or maintain our patients.
We actually do many of these MH set-ups at Toronto General Hospital, because it is the only MH Muscle Biopsy Clinic in Canada. Muscular biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing MH. We perform these biopsies under general anesthesia or neuraxial anesthesia. The biopsies cannot be performed using only local anesthesia, since local anesthetics near the biopsy site will impair the ability of the muscle to contract and cause a false test result. As Deena mentioned, we also scheduled this procedure as the first case of the day to minimize any residual volatile agents floating in the operating room or PACU post-surgery.

# Question 14

**Question:** Question 14: A patient is rushed into the operating room for an emergency surgery without enough time to complete the anesthesia gas machine checkout procedure. Discuss your approach to ensure the anesthesia gas machine is safe to use on this patient.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3865/View)

### Response 1 (Kelly Gram):
Depending on the scenario, the Aisys CS2 machine check takes around 6 minutes and runs automatically. This allows the anesthesia provider the ability to start the test and allow it to run while other tasks are completed like transferring, positioning and placing monitors on the patient. It would be a judgement call depending on the acuity of the patient and the time constraint.  In this example, the assumption is there is no time for the machine check and that the anesthesia provider is entering the room with the patient. Here are the following steps I would take:

- Check for a Bag Valve Mask (BVM) and ensure I have enough sedation medication available to run a total intravenous anesthetic (TIVA). This would be my backup plan should the unchecked gas machine malfunction.
- Check that the anesthetic gas machine (AGM) and monitors are powered on and check to see when the last checkout was done on the AGM and if it passed. The Aisys CS2 is the machine used at my site and it requires a full check out every 24 hours. This can be bypassed in the case of an emergency however a visual reminder to do the checkout remains on the screen.
- Test the O2 supply by pressing the O2 flush and turning on the auxiliary flowmeter to ensure you have a high pressure gas supply. I would also quickly visualize the wall connections ensuring the machine is connected to pipeline O2. There is also a readout on the Aisys showing the pipeline pressure confirming it is connected to the wall outlet.
- Check that the CO2 absorber is not exhausted and adequate for the case. It is also important to check that the vapourizer is adequately filled for the case.  While doing this you can visualize the patient circuit ensuring all components are present and connected, including the mask, the end-tidal CO2 line etc.
- Once these visuals are done, while connecting the patient to the monitor you can ensure the monitors are working appropriately.
- Do a circuit leak test. This can be done either via the machine circuit leak checkout or manually by turning up the APL valve, blocking the patient end of the circuit, pressurizing with the O2 flush button to ensure it adequately holds pressure, and then manually squeezing the reservoir bag a couple of times to simulate ventilation.

At this point we’ve established the machine is functional with a gas supply, working monitors, an operational patient circuit, an appropriate means to remove CO2, sufficient vapors so it is safe to proceed with the case with caution and close monitoring keeping in mind the machine is still not officially checked. However, ensuring a solid back up plan is imperative to proceeding so that you’re prepared if the machine shows any signs its not working properly.
Obviously using an unchecked machine is something that should be avoided but emergencies happen and we have to pivot, so our priority is to make things as safe as we can under the time constraints.

### Response 2 (Deena Kurilsky):
Thank you for sharing such a detailed approach Kelly! You’ve clearly considered the critical steps to ensure patient safety while navigating the challenge of using an unchecked machine. Your plan covers all the important bases, from ensuring you have an adequate backup plan, to checking the essential components of the anesthetic machine. I particularly appreciate how you incorporate a thorough visual check, often loose connections and leaks can be easily prevented this way.
 
The emphasis on close monitoring and having a backup plan in the case of a machine failure in this case is extremely important. The circuit leak test rules out any major leaks of the circuit but we cannot be sure the machine is 100% functional. What specific signs or issues would prompt you to transition immediately to your backup plan (TIVA or BVM) if you started noticing machine malfunction or patient instability? Are there any specific alarms or changes in readings that would trigger that decision for you?

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Hi Kelly, thanks for such a thorough and well-thought-out approach!
If this scenario happens at Toronto General Hospital (TGH), my simple solution is to bring the patient to our emergency operating room. As a transplant center, TGH has 2 emergency operating rooms. The gas machines in these 2 rooms are checked daily with the rest of the machines. This way, we would always be able to put the patient on a fully checked gas machine.  
If we are under such an emergency condition that we really need to bypass a full machine check, I will first quickly check when the last full test was done and what results were recorded, just as Kelly suggested. This would give me an idea of the overall safety of the gas machine. Then, I would at least do the minimal checks Kelly has listed. I would also check the suction, and have it on and ready for use, as this is an emergency surgery. However, we must remember that there are no accepted pre-anesthetic checkout procedures that are less than the full daily checkout procedures.   
Another option is using Kelly's suggested backup plan of using total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) as Plan A. Remember, we are never forced to use the gas machine for induction. We can always perform a TIVA, intubate, and then ventilate the patient using a bag-valve mask until the gas machine is properly checked.
:::
### Response 4 (Gregori Kuran):
Hi everyone, thank you for addressing this question, it is helpful to hear everyone's different perspectives. 

Similar to what Phoebe had mentioned about having the emergency rooms at Toronto General Hospital (TGH) checked daily with the other machines we have a similar situation/protocol at SickKids. We usually have 1-2 add on room that can always be used in emergency situations like this. All the machines in the SickKids operating rooms (OR) are checked daily by the OR respiratory therapist (RT). These room would have an anesthesia gas machine that have had the full check and would be ready to go. 

I also agree with what Phoebe had mentioned at the end of her post about how total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA is always available as an option. From my experience at SickKids I find that often most of the anesthesiologist tend to default towards a inhalational anesthetic, I think this has to do partially with the fact that with children we mostly do a full gas induction and get intravenous (IV) access afterwards. While the focus of this discussion isn’t TIVA versus inhalation volatile agent anesthetics I think this brings up a good opportunity to highlight in general TIVA has been shown to be superior to an inhalation anesthetic.1 Studies have found that TIVA is more effective than an inhalational anesthetic in preventing postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) and overall leading to better outcomes for the patient.1 In addition to preventing PONV it also been linked to shorter stays in recovery, quicker discharges and overall better patient satisfaction.1 preventing A further downside of inhalational anesthetics versus TIVA is that it has been shown to disrupt cerebral autoregulation while TIVA has been shown to maintain it.1 It is important when consider all these factors while assessing our patients as to what type of anesthetic would suit them best and their individual situation.

# Question 15

**Question:** Question 15: The anesthesia gas machine loses its main oxygen supply during the case. Explain how you would troubleshoot this situation and keep the patient safe throughout. Assume the patient is intubated and ventilated.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3864/View)

### Response 1 (Minna Jin):
When the anesthesia gas machine loses its main (pipeline) oxygen supply during a case, the oxygen failure alarm will alert the anesthesia provider about low oxygen pressure, and the fail-safe valve will be activated to prevent the delivery of hypoxic gas.
 
Potential causes of oxygen pipeline supply failure: 

**Human error**

**Equipment malfunction**

**Environmental **

Crossed pipelines

Pipeline leaks/disconnection

Freezing of regulators

Depletion of oxygen

Water and other contaminants in pipeline

Tornadoes 

Construction damage

Regulator malfunction

Lightning damage to regulators

Oxygen tank filled with other gases

Pipeline obstruction

 

Unannounced system shutdown

Retrograde contamination of supply from faulty nitrous oxide/oxygen blender

 

Pipeline compression

Emptying of bulk liquid oxygen tank

 

Nitrogen tank with oxygen fittings connected to bulk oxygen supply

 

 

(Weller et al., 2007)
**The following steps should be taken to ensure patient safety:  **

- **Confirm Oxygen Pipeline Connections**

- Verify that the oxygen pipeline is properly connected at the wall outlet and the anesthesia gas machine.
- If the issue is not due to disconnection, proceed to the next step.

- **Switch to the Backup Oxygen Cylinder**

Turn on the backup oxygen cylinder attached to the rear of the anesthesia machine as an alternative oxygen source. Ensure the cylinder is fully opened; otherwise, it may not empty completely (Dosch & Tharp, 2024).

- **Conserve Oxygen**

Close the circuit APL valve to allow manual ventilation and reduce gas flow to the minimum (250 mL/min) to conserve oxygen (Weller et al., 2007).

**Avoid using the bellows-driven ventilator**, which relies on oxygen as the driving gas, as it will waste the oxygen supply.
Manually ventilate with the reservoir bag of the breathing circuit instead of the bag-valve-mask. The breathing circuit allows the administration of volatile agents and conserves oxygen by recycling exhaled oxygen. In contrast, the Ambu bag is non-rebreathing and depends entirely on fresh oxygen for every breath, increasing oxygen consumption (Dosch & Tharp, 2024; Weller et al., 2007).

- **Monitor Patient Parameters**

Ensure adequate oxygenation, anesthetic agent administration, and ventilation by closely monitoring the patient's oximetry and ETCO₂.

- **Notify the Surgical and Anesthesia Teams**

Inform the surgical team and the anesthesia team about the loss of the main oxygen supply.
The surgical team may need to adjust the pace or type of surgical interventions to minimize stress on the patient until the oxygen supply is restored.

- **Call for Additional Oxygen Cylinders**

Secure additional oxygen cylinders to maintain an adequate supply.

- **Disconnect the Failed Pipeline in Case of Crossover**

If a crossover occurs (non-oxygen gas flows through the oxygen pipeline), disconnect the pipeline from the wall (Dosch & Tharp, 2024). 

- **Notify the Biomedical/Engineering Department**

Contact the hospital’s biomedical or engineering department. They are responsible for the pipeline system and can investigate and resolve the issue, whether it is due to a mechanical failure, pipeline obstruction, or a system-wide problem.

- **Continue with manual ventilation and monitor the patient’s hemodynamic stability until the end of surgery or the restoration of the oxygen pipeline supply.**

If the hospital pipeline supply is restored, **do not reconnect it** until it has been tested and verified to deliver 100% oxygen and confirmed to be free from contamination by other gases (Weller et al., 2007).

 
The hospital medical gas pipeline system is inspected by a qualified service technician every six months (CPSBC, 2023). Although oxygen pipeline failure is rare, when it occurs, it can significantly impact patient care and potentially lead to catastrophic events if medical staff are not adequately trained to execute an emergency response. To mitigate risks, it is essential to perform a pre-operative machine check, ensuring that the backup oxygen cylinder is full, properly attached to the back of the anesthesia gas machine, and ready for emergency use. The anesthesia provider must ensure adequate oxygenation and ventilation while employing oxygen-conserving strategies. Continuous monitoring of the patient’s hemodynamic stability throughout the surgery is crucial. In the event of pipeline failure, the anesthesia provider should collaborate with the surgical team, anesthesia team, and hospital biomedical/engineering department to address the issue promptly while maintaining patient care.

### Response 2 (Meera Sathananthan):
Thank you for sharing such a detailed and thoughtful post, Minna! Your breakdown of oxygen pipeline failure causes and emergency management steps is both insightful and practical. It reminded me of the planned oxygen and nitrous oxide shutdown we experienced at our hospital a couple of weeks ago, which underscored the importance of preparation and adaptability in maintaining patient safety during such events.
Given that this shutdown was planned and over the weekend, when we have less ORs running, we had the time to calculate flow rates for anesthesia gas machines (6–8 LPM) and determine E-cylinder durations in advance. We were able to ensure each OR, as well as the satellite areas, were well equipped to handle their cases during the shutdown. To conserve oxygen, we used “grab-and-go” cylinders for oxygen therapy and bag-mask ventilation, ensuring adequate supply throughout the event. Clear communication with the anesthesia team about conservation strategies and contingency plans was critical in preventing disruptions to patient care​.
Your mention of training also aligns with findings, where in-situ simulation significantly improved anesthesia providers' ability to manage sudden oxygen supply failures (1). While simulation training is effective, it may not always be feasible due to resource constraints like staffing shortages. In these cases, practical alternatives, such as interactive learning modules or easy-to-access concise emergency response guides, can help fill the gap. These tools ensure that staff have access to actionable protocols and decision-making frameworks when needed.
From my perspective, one of the most valuable lessons during the shutdown was the importance of preparation, including calculating oxygen needs and establishing backup plans. This experience highlighted how collaboration and detailed planning are key to maintaining patient safety even in challenging situations.
Thank you again for sharing this post, Minna. Your detailed analysis and emphasis on preparation offer a strong foundation for addressing rare but critical events like oxygen pipeline failures.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Minna, for a great discussion on oxygen supply failure. I especially appreciate the inclusion of the potential causes of oxygen pipeline supply failure.
I agree wholeheartedly with Meera that it would be invaluable to have routine operating room mock simulations on this type of scenario. With my other hat as the Anesthesia Simulation Centre Coordinator, I often advocate for crisis scenario simulations, but unfortunately, due to logistic reasons, it is quite difficult to implement.
Minna is correct that we should avoid using a bellows ventilator and switch to manual ventilation if oxygen is required to drive the ventilator, as this can quickly deplete the emergency oxygen cylinder. However, in some gas machine models, there is an option to switch the ventilator driving gas to medical air. In this case, we can still continue mechanical ventilation. We can also continue mechanical ventilation with a piston or turbine ventilator, as driving gas is not required. Nevertheless, we should always reduce fresh gas flow, and also use the lowest FiO2 possible by increasing the flow of medical air.
It is definitely a good plan to gather additional E-size oxygen cylinders. Many of our new gas machines have a two-oxygen yoke system. This is to ensure that we always have a completely full and closed cylinder attached to the machine. We should be only opening one of the cylinders during our daily routine check. This double system also minimizes the disruption of FiO2 delivery to the patient by allowing us to quickly exchange the empty cylinder while using the other cylinder.  
Lastly, we should also inquire about the estimated length of the gas supply failure. If we anticipate that the gas supply failure is going to be for an extended period, instead of gathering many E-size cylinders, another option is to access the operating room zone valves. The zone valves can permit or shut off access to pipeline supplies for certain areas. Using the zone valves, we could isolate the operating room and backfill it with larger H-size oxygen cylinders. Just for a quick comparison, an H-size cylinder contains ~7000 L of oxygen versus ~680 L in an E-size cylinder. It will definitely save many cylinder changes 😅.

# Question 16

**Question:** Question 16: The anesthesia gas machine loses its power supply during the case. Explain how you would troubleshoot this situation and keep the patient safe throughout. Assume the patient is intubated and ventilated.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3863/View)

### Response 1 (Meera Sathananthan):
Power Outage Anesthesia Gas Machine Scenario

 
In the event that the anesthesia gas machine (AGM) loses power during a case involving an intubated and ventilated patient, patient safety must remain the absolute priority. Below is a systematic approach to troubleshooting this scenario while utilizing the emergency protocols and guidelines. Power continuity in anesthesia settings is critical to patient safety, as even brief interruptions can lead to significant risks.
Power failures in healthcare settings are not just theoretical concerns. The Northeast Blackout of 2003 demonstrated how widespread power failures can affect even facilities with backup systems. While most hospitals have emergency generators designed to activate within approximately 10 seconds of power loss, both generators and backup systems have proven to be not completely reliable (1). Additionally, even brief interruptions in power can damage sensitive equipment, including fluoroscopy machines and transesophageal echocardiography probes, or interrupt emergent care, highlighting the need for comprehensive preparation (1)
1.   Common sources of power loss (1)
A.     Regional disasters
B.     Extreme weather events
C.     Local disruption of municipal power
D.    Emergency generator failures during a widespread power outage
E.     Faulty internal electrical systems that are uncovered by construction work
2.   Emergency Protocol: Establishing Ventilation and Oxygenation
A.     Manual ventilation strategies
Ensuring that ventilation and oxygenation are maintained is the highest priority. Most AGMs have internal batteries that can last 3-4 hours. With the AGM power supply lost, switch to manual ventilation using a bag-valve-mask. This approach is effective and helps conserve battery life on the anesthesia machine (2). The anesthesia machine's battery life can be extended by up to an hour if the ventilator is turned off and manual ventilation is utilized (1) (Figure 1.0).

Figure 1.0: These machines were tested with ventilator on and ventilator off to see how long they would operate on their internal batteries.
B.     Securing emergency oxygen and anesthetic supply
It is critical to establish an emergency oxygen supply, either from wall-mounted oxygen or from portable oxygen cylinders, to provide a reliable oxygen source. Fresh gas flow, rotometers, and the oxygen flush valve operate independently of power (1, 3). Sevo output also remains consistent with dialed settings despite no power (1). Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) can also be utilized as it operates independently of power (1, 3). TIVA is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the delivery of inhalational anesthetic agents is compromised due to power outages. It provides a reliable way to maintain anesthesia depth without relying on electrical systems that are vulnerable during a power failure. Using TIVA helps ensure patient stability and safety, especially when volatile agent delivery systems are unavailable or unreliable.
Generally, all devices made clear alarms, audibly and visually, of impending battery failure prior to turning off (1).
3.   Call for Help, Check Status of Surgery
Upon experiencing a power outage, the first priority is ensuring patient safety: verifying that the patient is ventilating effectively, perfusing adequately, oxygenating properly, and still receiving anesthesia. Follow these steps:
A.     Call for immediate assistance: Having extra hands available is crucial to help manage various tasks such as manually ventilating the patient or locating emergency equipment (4).
B.     Assess the current surgical status: Can the surgery be safely aborted? If it is safe, consider waking and extubating the patient, as this would reduce the reliance on power-dependent equipment (1).
4.   Sources of Backup Lighting and Monitoring
A.     Backup Lighting: Backup lighting is necessary to ensure visibility in the operating room. If power loss also affects the OR lights, use flashlights or other available battery-powered lights to maintain visibility (4) Flashlights on cellphones may also be, though they often require extra hands or some creative improvisation to be practical in an operating room setting.
B.     Portable Monitoring: For monitoring, it is essential to switch to battery-powered portable monitors to track the patient's vitals continuously. Phillips monitors, for example, may fail within 15 minutes of a power loss, so having a transport monitor ready helps prevent gaps in monitoring (1).
5.   Managing Anesthesia and Equipment
In the event of equipment failure, there are several potential risks to patient safety, such as inadequate ventilation, oxygenation, and anesthesia delivery. To mitigate these risks:
- Use manual alternatives such as a bag-valve-mask for ventilation.
- Switch to Total Intravenous Anesthesia (TIVA) to sustain anesthesia depth if volatile agent delivery becomes unreliable. Monitoring equipment should also be backed up with battery-powered alternatives to avoid interruptions in assessing the patient's vital signs (3).
It is reassuring to note that sevoflurane delivery can remain consistent even without power; however, reliance on this must be evaluated cautiously (1).
Check all equipment for battery status and power needs. Devices such as infusion pumps (e.g., Alaris) and electronic monitors tend to have limited battery backup, often failing within minutes to half an hour. Prioritize conserving battery life for devices essential to the patient's immediate safety (1).
6.   EMERGENCY KITS AND PREPARATION

Figure 2.0: Example of an emergency monitoring kit in the event of a power outage. Includes: LED headlamp, sphygmomanometer, stethoscope, portable pulse oximeter, colorimetric CO2 detector, paper anesthetic records for documentation, and a checklist for quick reference (1).
Being prepared for an OR power failure requires familiarity with emergency equipment locations and a proactive approach to checking battery status and backup supplies regularly (3). An emergency kit containing flashlights, portable oxygen cylinders, and manual bag-valve masks should be readily available. Regular testing of emergency generators is also essential to ensure backup power becomes available swiftly when needed (1).
7.   Regular Testing of Emergency Generators
Most hospitals have emergency generators that kick in within approximately 10 seconds of a blackout (2). During this short window, all critical equipment should already be supported by internal battery power. However, even these brief interruptions can significantly impact critical equipment, from robotic surgery tools to imaging devices. Regular testing of these generators and maintaining an understanding of equipment battery duration will help mitigate these risks (4).
8.   Checklists and cognitive
Having physical checklists of key actions during a power failure is crucial to ensure a systematic response. Below is an example:

- Check patient safety or if immediate intervention is needed (e.g., AGM does not switch to internal battery).
- Call for immediate assistance.
- Manually ventilate using a bag-valve-mask.
- Establish an emergency oxygen supply.
- Switch to backup lighting (may need to include cell phone flashlights in addition to other equipment) and portable monitors.
- Evaluate whether to continue or abort surgery.
- Consider switching to TIVA if necessary.

Making physical copies of quick reference guides is helpful. As most hospital centers are transitioning to electronic systems and charting, accessing policies and procedures online may not be possible during power loss. Having physical copies eliminates this risk, enabling clinicians to have the necessary resources available.
 
 

Figure 3.0: An example of a physical cognitive aid to help clinicians with systematically navigating power supply issues intraoperatively (1).
Power outages in the operating room are high-risk scenarios that require immediate, well-coordinated responses. Preparation, teamwork, and regular training are essential to ensure clinicians are confident and capable of managing these situations effectively. Has anyone had experiences with power outages in the hospital before? Would love to hear personal recounts.

### Response 2 (Shawn Page):
Meera,
Great job with including all the steps to take in an emergency.  I actually never ever thought about equipment failure because I have always relied on teh safety net of the back up generators. 
I really like the idea of the emergency kit with the manual BP and battery operated SpO2 probe.  This is something I'm going to bring up at my organization, so thank you!!

### Response 3 (Meera Sathananthan):
Thanks Shawn! I have to see whether the hospital I'm at has any kits or emergency protocols in place too that don't rely on the generators. In 2003, most hospitals either had code greens and evacuated patients that needed more support or they used their backup generators for days. Always good to be prepared for the worst, and hope for the best 😅

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Excellent discussion on the power outage! 
Fortunately, a widespread power outage is very rare, and my only experience was the blackout in 2003, as Meera mentioned. The gas machines were all plugged into the backup generator red outlets and smoothly switched to the backup generator. I agree with Meera that the biggest problem was lighting, though. We tried to bring in every portable light and flashlight we could find. We do have a flashlight in the drawer of all gas machines.  
The anesthesia gas machine comes with a backup battery to help deal with a sudden power outage. It is very important that we keep our equipment fully charged at all times. Even spare gas machines in the storage area need to be plugged in to keep the backup battery charged. Also, we should always plug gas machines into the red power outlets connected to backup generators (if applicable).   
In addition, it is also a good idea to know which components of your gas machines are powered by the backup battery and which are not. For example, the electrical outlets on the back of Aisys gas machine are not powered by the backup battery. Therefore, our gas machine’s vital signs monitor will stop working immediately if we lose the main power supply. We would need to switch to a portable transport monitor with a backup battery.  
In the case when even the backup generator is not working, and it becomes a complete widespread power outage with an intubated and ventilated patient, my first question is whether the anesthetic ventilator is still working, as nicely detailed in the algorithm in Meera’s post. If the ventilator is working (with the backup battery), we could continue normal use of the ventilator but with non-desflurane vaporizers. We should avoid desflurane since the vaporizer must be heated, which will deplete the battery life. If the ventilator is not working (the backup battery is depleted), we should switch to manual ventilation in bag mode.
In addition, we should also switch to 100% oxygen because the medical air pipeline may fail during a widespread power failure if it is supplied by a compressor system. The suction (vacuum) system may not work either, and having a portable battery-operated suction is important. Also, as Meera mentioned, we should be ready to switch to TIVA when needed. For monitoring, we would need a battery-operated transport monitor or any portable oximeter and manual blood pressure monitor.  
In the worst-case scenario, we can always bag the patient with an ambu bag on room air while administering TIVA, putting a finger on the pulse, as well as using the laryngoscope or cellphone as a light source.  I hope that we will never need to get to this point!

# Question 17

**Question:** Question 17: A patient cannot be ventilated or intubated, what are your immediate steps to manage the patient’s airway? Discuss the role of alternative airway devices.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3862/View)

### Response 1 (Janet Rozek):
To answer this question in a sequential way I would like to review some important airway pathways that help with decision making and problem solving in this type of scenario that we may encounter in our practice. The Canadian Airway Focus Group reviews recommendations with evidence that applies to difficulty encountered with unanticipated difficult airway management in an unconscious patient.  Important things to acknowledge is careful airway evaluations before the induction of general anesthesia (Law et al., 2021).
(Law et al., 2021)
This image I have provided reviews the recommendations of an unanticipated difficult airway. Starting at the top left of the algorithm we acknowledge the first attempt at tracheal intubation is unsuccessful, moving down the pathway, the next important thing to address is, “is ventilation and oxygenation maintained by face mask ventilation (FMV) or subglottic airway device (SGA)?” (Law et al., 2021).
To answer this question, we move along the algorithm to the NO side of the pathway. 
The patient is not able to be intubated or ventilated. 
The first thing that is required is CALL FOR HELP!
The patient will quickly become hypoxemic and need further intervention and is in danger!
The recommendation is to prepare for emergency front of neck airway access.
Concurrently it is necessary to ensure sufficient neuromuscular blockade (NMB) is given, the recommendation is to make a single attempt to do the following if not yet attempted:

- Subglottic airway device 
- Face mask ventilation optimized by NMB
- Hyper-angulated blade video laryngoscopy 

If one of these recommendations are successful the pathway recommends consideration of an exit strategy, options include:

- Awaken patient
- Place SGA and wait
- Additional tracheal intubation attempt
- Surgical airway

If still unsuccessful, the emergency strategy is emergency front of neck airway without further delay.
 
To review, the recommendations begin with response to difficult FMV, SGA are used to assist ventilation and may be used as a conduit to facilitate flexible bronchoscope guided tracheal intubation.
The second recommendation reviews difficulty with tracheal intubation and/or difficult glottic exposure by direct or video laryngoscopy.

- Ensure neuromuscular blockade
- Apply external laryngeal manipulation (not cricoid pressure)
- Ensure the Macintosh blade is inserted sufficiently deep into the vallecula to engage the hyoepiglottic ligament
- Consider directly lifting the epiglottis (applies to both Macintosh and straight blades)
- Exaggerate head lift and ‘‘sniff’’ positions, if not contraindicated
- Release any applied cricoid pressure
- For continued difficulty with glottic exposure, if the patient remains well-oxygenated, strongly consider progressing to Hyper-angulated or hyper-curved blade video laryngoscopy
- Consider using tracheal introducer (bougie) (Law et al., 2021)

Important to keep track of timing, oxygenation and intubation attempts (max up to 3-4 attempts)
After each attempt, something should be optimized with device or operator

- Flexible bronchoscope on its own
- Flexible bronchoscope guided intubation through SGA
- Flexible bronchoscope used in combination with video laryngoscopy

 
May need to consider nasal prongs at 5-15L/min to maintain safe oxygen range between attempts.
If all these strategies and attempts fail, an exit strategy is recommended to 

- Awaken the patient- with both difficult ventilation and oxygenation and failed tracheal intubation recommendation if feasible is to awaken patient and re consider anesthesia plan such as awake intubation if case is urgent
- Use the SGA and wait for patient emergence from anesthesia, not advised to keep SGA to continue case in case of SGA malfunction and no fallback option available

To conclude if true emergency where all tools and providers fail to ventilate and oxygenate, and emergency surgical airway would be needed. 
The Canadian Airway Focus group advises using a scalpel-bougie-tube technique for cricothyrotomy. First, make an initial 4–6 cm longitudinal incision over the estimated midline of the larynx in all adult patients. Then, perform a transverse incision through the cricothyroid membrane. Maintain access to the opened trachea using the airway manager's finger or by turning the scalpel blade inward. Insert the bougie into the trachea behind the placeholder finger or alongside the blade. After removing the finger or blade, advance a 6.0-mm internal diameter cuffed tube (for adult patients) over the bougie. Finally, inflate the cuff and confirm the correct tube placement (Law et al., 2021).

### Response 2 (Kurt Protacio):
Thanks Janet for your detailed post. I found it useful that you provided an algorithm diagram to illustrate the steps needed to establish an airway in a 'Can't Intubate, Can't Oxygenate' (CICO) scenario.
Familiarizing ourselves by training with these airway devices will help in a CICO event and potentially improve patient outcomes. In the United Kingdom (UK), there are usually two CICO kits, one containing equipment for a cannula cricothyroidotomy and another containing a scalpel bougie, held in transparent bags located along the walls of all operating rooms (ORs). The Rapid-O2 oxygen insufflation device is an important piece in the immediate return of oxygenation after successful cannula cricothyroidotomy as it connects directly to the patient's airway (via cannula) and can further increase oxygenation within seconds and restore spontaneous circulation in pulseless electrical activity (PEA) scenarios as well (Wexler et al., 2018).
You mentioned in the latter of your post the steps for a cricothyrotomy, and using a scalpel to gain access to the patient's airway. There has been a lot of debate as to which front-of-neck airway (FONA) approach is better; however, the 2015 Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guideline for management of an unanticipated difficult intubation has recommended a scalpel bougie FONA procedure, which includes a 6.0mm cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) (Baker et al., 2016). The patient, once stabilized, can then proceed to the OR for a formal tracheostomy formation if needed. Although it may seem "simpler" for anesthetists to insert a cannula into an airway rather than placing a scalpel, recent studies show that the cannula approach has a higher failure rate in an CICO crisis (Baker et al., 2016).
I was wondering at your worksite if/where the CICO kits containing the equipment needed for a cricothyroidotomy are located if not on the code blue resuscitation cart?

### Response 3 (Meera Sathananthan):
Thank you, Janet and Kurt, for your thoughtful insights. Janet, your structured approach to managing CICO emergencies emphasizes the critical value of well-defined protocols, while Kurt’s focus on standardized equipment, such as the Rapid-O2 device, highlights the importance of preparation in high-stakes scenarios. I’d like to share perspectives from my practice at St. Michael’s Hospital.
Early recognition and timely intervention are pivotal in difficult airway management. Calling for help after the first failed intubation attempt ensures the rapid mobilization of resources and expertise, as Janet highlighted. For example, with additional support, we often employ a technique we call "The Special," which combines GlideScope video laryngoscopy for visualizing the cords and fiberoptic intubation for precise navigation of an endotracheal tube. This synergistic approach has proven invaluable in challenging airways. However, repeated intubation attempts can worsen airway swelling, complicating subsequent maneuvers, including surgical options. Evidence supports that early, decisive action reduces complications and improves outcomes (1).
Neuromuscular blockade (NMBA) reversal adds another dimension to airway management that may be worth considering (2). In cases of difficult visualization or multiple intubation attempts, sugammadex offers a rapid reversal of rocuronium or vecuronium, potentially reducing airway inflammation and enabling a controlled awake intubation later. This has happened a few times in our OR. Sugammadex has a rapid onset (3–5 minutes), which is particularly advantageous in emergent scenarios. In contrast, neostigmine—used to reverse succinylcholine—has a slower onset (approximately 7 minutes) and requires co-administration with anticholinergics, making it less suited for time-sensitive situations (3, 4). While the use of an NMBA reversal is an option, it is not yet widely used in this context though it could serve as an adjunctive strategy in difficult airway management, perhaps being implemented earlier to prevent airway inflammation.
The broader implications of sugammadex merit consideration. Its increasing use, especially in high-risk populations such as patients with obesity or respiratory comorbidities, underscores its role in improving patient safety by minimizing residual paralysis. However, as its application grows, clinicians must remain alert to potential adverse effects, such as bradycardia, particularly in patients taking medications that modulate heart rate (3, 4).
Has anyone had experience with NMBA reversal, such as sugammadex, during a difficult airway situation?

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Excellent discussion! Thanks for everyone’s insights into the difficult airway crisis. We will be practicing this in simulations next semester.
I believe timing is a major factor in the management of difficult airways. First, Janet reminded us of the importance of neuromuscular blockade. I have worked with many students in learning the intubation technique and often found them rushing to insert the endotracheal tube before the patient was adequately paralyzed. Neuromuscular blocking agents need time to kick in, and that is why manual ventilation after the patient is asleep is so crucial during normal asleep intubation. Without achieving the proper neuromuscular blockade, an easy airway can become difficult, because we cannot obtain the best glottic view for insertion.
On the other hand, once we recognize that it is a failed intubation, we need to move quickly to the next steps in the algorithm, whether it is an exit strategy or establishing an emergency front-of-neck airway access. The Canadian Airway Focus Group has changed the terminology “cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate” (CICO) to “cannot ventilate, cannot oxygenate” (CVCO) to de-emphasize the many ineffective attempts at tracheal intubation to an already very hypoxic patient. The key is establishing ventilation of any kind, not a tracheal intubation. They also mentioned that with a Grade 3b or 4 Cormack-Lehane view, intubation with direct laryngoscopy or video laryngoscopy is often impossible, and an alternate device is required (Law et al., 2021). Below is the table regarding the grading scale for laryngoscopy: (Law et al., 2021)
Lastly, I want to comment on Meera’s “The Special” technique. We have also used this GlideScope and fiberoptic bronchoscope combined technique to intubate many of our difficult airways successfully. This combined technique works because it eliminates the limitations of each of the techniques separately. As Meera mentioned, the fiberoptic bronchoscope can help navigate the tube through the glottis, which is often difficult with the GlideScope. The GlideScope can provide a direct visual of the tube loading off the bronchoscope into the glottis, a blind spot during fiberoptic intubation.

### Response 5 (Shawn Page):
Hello,
Phoebe, I'm glad you mentioned the "cannot ventilate, cannot oxygenate" change in philosophy.  I have seen newer MDs and RRTs continue to try and place an airway after failed attempts.  I have also seen a lot of blood being suctioned up in those attempts.
So I think it's an important concept that we need to rewire our brains and focus on the ventilation and oxygenation aspects, instead of the placement of an airway.

# Question 18 (Student #1)

**Question:** Question 18: What is the most common problem with airway equipment? Describe an example from your experience and how the issue was resolved. (Student #1)

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3861/View)

### Response 1 (Dan Chen):
As a respiratory therapist, one of the most common issues I had dealt with airway equipment is leakage or improper seal in cuffed endotracheal tubes (ETTs) and tracheostomy tubes. This can lead to ineffective ventilation, inadequate oxygenation, or even patient discomfort. A poor seal can result from cuff deflation, cuff rupture, or improper tube placement. 

In this example, a 15-month-old infant who had undergone surgery for a congenital heart defect. Due to the complexity of the procedure and the need for post-surgical ventilation, the child was intubated with an oral 4.0 cuffed ETT. The procedure went smoothly, and the child was transferred to the cardiac ICU for monitoring and further respiratory support. However, after admission to the unit, the child began showing signs of inadequate ventilation despite being on the same mechanical ventilation settings.  

I noticed this problem initially when I saw that the ventilator alarms were sounding, indicating low tidal volume (Vt). The target Vt has decreased from 6 ml/kg to 3 ml/kg.  

Troubleshooting: I began by assessing that the ETT was still secured at reference distance at the lip. I quickly examined for kinks or disconnections in the circuit and tubing but found no issues. Bilateral air entry clear upon auscultation. The ventilator settings were configured correctly, but the volume-time waveform on the ventilator was showing signs of volume not returning to baseline, suggesting inadequate tidal volume delivery. 

Solution: Given these findings, I suspected a leak in the airway. I decided to assess the ETT cuff pressure to ensure it was inflated. Upon checking, I discovered that the cuff was slightly deflated, likely due to either cuff deflation or a malfunction. I immediately inflated the cuff to 20cmH2O pressure by checking using a pressure manometer. Once the cuff was properly inflated, the tidal volume on the ventilator returned to the target range, and the ventilator alarms stopped sounding. 

This situation reinforced the importance of regularly monitoring the cuff pressure of ETTs and tracheostomy tubes, as even a small leak can lead to significant changes in ventilation and oxygenation. Additionally, it highlighted the value of thorough troubleshooting when mechanical ventilator alarms occur, as they can be indicative of underlying issues with the airway or circuit.

### Response 2 (Reneerose Ong):
Great discussion Dan! Your example highlights the importance of ensuring a proper seal and adequate cuff inflation, especially in pediatric patients. With their smaller airway diameters and limited respiratory reserves, children are particularly vulnerable to complications from even minor cuff leaks. These issues can lead to ineffective ventilation, oxygen desaturation, increased work of breathing, and a heightened risk of aspiration—concerns that are especially significant in a post-surgical cardiac patient already at higher risk for complications (Shaikh et al, 2021).
Your detailed troubleshooting process and quick action to assess and adjust the cuff pressure are excellent examples of how systematic problem-solving can prevent further deterioration. Using a manometer to confirm proper cuff inflation not only resolved the immediate issue but also stresses the value of regular cuff pressure monitoring. This simple yet crucial step can make a significant difference in maintaining effective ventilation while avoiding risks like tracheal injury or airway edema from overinflation or ventilation compromise from underinflation (Shaikh et al, 2021).
Your case serves as a great reminder of the importance of attention to detail and proactive management in pediatric airway care. Thank you for sharing such an insightful and well-managed case!

### Response 3 (Deena Kurilsky):
Thank you for your contributions Dan and Reneerose. I wanted to touch further on the importance of cuff pressures and the prevention of laryngeal injury as you both pointed out.Post-intubation laryngeal edema has the potential to cause respiratory difficulty and/or stridor following extubating. This pathologic process resulting in edema can begin shortly after intubation if appropriate cuff pressures are not monitored. Unfortunately, even with a positive cuff leak test it may only become clinically evident after removal of the endotracheal tube (Kumar, 2023). Depending on the severity and clinical condition of the patient immediate re-intubation may be required. If the patient is clinically stable, close monitoring and treatment with nebulized epinephrine and IV dexamethasone as well as a lasix based on fluid volume status may be initiated.
 
It is important to note that one-third of adverse airway events occur during the emergence or recovery phase in anesthesia. The importance of checking cuff pressures as Dan stated is just as important in the OR as it is in intensive care units. Using a high-volume, low-pressure cuff and keeping cuff pressures < 25cmH20 can help prevent these complications. Other common adverse events that you may encounter after extubating are laryngospasm and bronchospasm (Lilaonitkul & Infosino, 2023).

### Response 4 (Minna Jin):
Great discussions, everyone. Thank you, Dan, for sharing your story of ETT cuff leakage and its impact on a pediatric lung. It is a great example to show how a small detail can have a huge impact on a patient's overall ventilatory status. It’s definitely one of the most common problems in the ICU. I’ve noticed that, besides changes in monitor parameters such as decreasing tidal volume and SpO2, cuff leakage often presents with an auditory cue, like a "gurgling" sound. Upon hearing that sound, I always double-check the cuff by manually palpating the pilot balloon and assessing the pressure difference. Another common practice I’ve observed is attaching a pressure cap to the pilot balloon if leakage continues to recur. I'm not sure if this is a standard practice in other facilities.
Thank you, Reneerose, for highlighting the use of a manometer. I’ve actually never seen this device in the ICU before, but it’s definitely a great idea for cuff pressure monitoring and leak prevention. It would be nice to have them available in both ICU and OR settings.
Thank you, Deena, for bringing attention to the issue of post-intubation laryngeal edema and emphasizing the importance of maintaining cuff pressure < 25 cmH2O. There’s also clinical evidence supporting the benefits of prophylactic steroids in preventing post-extubation edema or stridor (Kumar & Cascella, 2023).

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks for bringing up about cuff leaks.  
Just want to add that the leaks may not just be the cuff itself, but the valve too. When we are testing the integrity of the endotracheal tube, we should take off the syringe once the cuff is inflated and then check for leaks. If we skip this step of taking off the syringe, a leaky valve may not be noticed right away. 
Regarding Minna’s point, I have not tried putting a pressure cap on the pilot balloon. I do remember that one time we had a leak in the valve or pilot line, instead of exchanging the tube, the anesthesiologist tried to salvage it (because the patient was very close to extubation) with a 25 g needle, a three-way stopcock, and a 10-cc syringe.

# Question 18 (Student #2)

**Question:** Question 18: What is the most common problem with airway equipment? Describe an example from your experience and how the issue was resolved. (Student #2)

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3859/View)

### Response 1 (Ryan Smith):
By in large one the most common problem in airway equipment and (delivery of positive pressure) is leaks to atmosphere of delivered gases to a patient. The potential for leaks is a product of equipment factors combined with patient specific factors. For the current discussion let us consider a common potential equipment leaks in the operating theatre, and patient characteristics that may lead to leaks, with a case example.

Some OR equipment leak potential sites:

- 
**AGM ventilator circuit.** Rightfully so, it is a CSA standard to perform daily AGM pressure and leak tests. Depending on the institution specific guidelines, pressure tests should be performed with each new circuit placed on the AGM ventilator. Common leak sites include: reservoir bag (the bag material itself or the 22mm connection), 22mm connections at the inspiratory and expiratory connections, end tidal lines not being securely seated in their luer lock housing, LMA/ETT connection being properly seated/secured especially if the patient is re-positioned after placement of said airway device.

- 
**CO****2**** absorbent canister.** Ensure the canister is properly seated in its housing and any levers are fully engaged. Visual inspection for canister cracks can be part of the daily AGM checks.

- 
**ETT cuff or LMA cuff (inflatable LMA). **In the ICU an ETT cuff leak is by far the most common leak site. Standards for cuff monitoring vary from region to region and institution but the most common cuff surveillance techniques are the cuff manometer (targeting 15-20mmhg) or the minimal occlusion volume (least amount of added air to achieve a good seal). ETTs and inflatable LMAs should be checked prior to every case for cuff integrity and absence of leaks.

Patient specific factors to consider:

- 
**ETTs and LMAs are sized by age and gender**. Male gender necessitates a larger caliber ETT and LMA. Taller individuals necessitates larger caliber ETT and LMA as well.

- 
**Time of indwelling airway**: For a patient whom is already intubated (for example from ICU, Emergency) the potential for tracheomalacia is a product of time spent in the airway and age. The older a person is, the more likely tracheomalacia will be present, as well the longer the indwelling time of an cuffed ETT (or tracheostomy) the greater the chance of tracheomalacia with accompanying leak. It is important to clinicians that the cuff pressure of an ETT or tracheostomy tube not exceed 15-20mmhg as this may cause mucosal damage and potentially tracheomalacia. Should an increasing cuff pressure be required, clinicians should opt for a larger bore ETT or tracheostomy, or a longer tracheostomy and advance or withdraw the ETT 1cm at a time to change the site where the cuff bears upon the tracheal mucosa.

- 
**Torturous trachea geometry**. In general the older a person is the more likely the trachea will not be perfectly linear. This is not a predictable phenomennon except in the case of scoliosis or kyphoscoliosis for example. An anteior-posterior as well as lateral chest xray can elucidate this information if the clinician is concerned pre-operatively (ct scan being even more definitive although arguably not justified except in extreme thorax/neck architecture deformity).

**Case Study**

From the operating theatre recently I recall on LMA leak that required quick attention and resolution.

The case was a 55 year old male, 170cm in height with a BMI of 30. This is a large person that required an LMA for total shoulder replacement (in this case the surgeon requests LMA rather than deep sedation and a simple oxygen mask with end tidal monitoring as their standard practice). The patient was given a regional block per usual care (interscalene shot with an indwelling catheter for post-operative pain control). The patient was sedated with 2mg midazolam immediately before the block procedure with oxygen simple mask 6lpm and usual monitors. The regional block procedure was unremarkable and the patient was taken to the operating theatre sedated but able to appropriately respond to questions and assist with positioning to the OR surgical table.

Usual patient positioning was done, an upright chair position, a few degrees of trendelenberg and a head holder keeping the head in an anatomically neutral position with a facial sponge face holding securement device. The patient was pre-oxygenated with fresh gas flow of 15lpm at 100% oxygen for approximately 4-5minutes until EtO2 reached 90%. Induction medication was given (in this case 140mg propofol). The patient continued to breath spontaneously with effective loss of response to stimuli. The anesthetist chose a #5 iGel LMA, which was well lubricated and advanced in usual fashion in one pass into a well seated position. The wye with a flex tube was attached to the LMA, the APL turned up to aproximately 8cmh20 and slow, careful breaths were delivered using the reservoir bag (sevoflorane not yet turned on). A leak was immediately audible at the bedside. Myself and the anesthetist removed the wye connector and carefully withdrew the iGel LMA and re-inserted in usual fashion, this time with a slightly more aggressive jaw thrust. The iGel was again advanced without any significant resistance and seated in usual fashion. Again the wye was connected and leak was again audible.

The iGel was removed, the anesthetist and myself weighed the option of conversion to a general anesthetic with ETT vs trying a different LMA. We decided to try a traditional inflatable, re-processable LMA #5 before converting to general anesthetic. The patient was reservoir bag-mask ventilated with good effect for a further 2-3 minutes while I prepared the LMA. The #5 LMA was completely deflated and re-inflated with 10cc of air for a semi-inflated insertion per the anesthetist request. The LMA was generously lubricated, and when the EtO2 again reached 90% and we assessed that sedation was still adequate the LMA was advanced in usual fashion. It seated easily and was inflated with a further 8cc of air to achieve a good seal. The LMA was taped strongly and the case then proceeded in usual fashion.

This case underscores the importance of having *secondary airway equipment ready within the arms reach of the AGM for all cases*. It is common setup in the operating theatres in our institution to have #3, 4, 5 iGel and #3, 4, 5 standard inflatable LMAs in the anesthetic cart directly adjacent to the AGM. iGels are a common rescue supraglottic airway used by most EMS regions now and many difficult airway carts across hospitals, however airway clinicians must be keenly aware of the capabilities and limitations. Another common emergency airway adjunct found taped to the side of all our AGMs is a bougie. Beyond this a comprehensive difficult airway cart is situated in a central corridor, no more than 25 paces from any operating theatre.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks for sharing your experience, Ryan!
I absolutely agree with your comment that we need to be aware of the capabilities and limitations of our equipment.
There is an increasing trend of using video laryngoscopy, especially after the pandemic, but I think we should never lose our basic skills like direct laryngoscopy. You never know when you will ever encounter situations where you cannot use a video laryngoscopy, such as an unclear view, camera damage, or an uncharged machine. Also, when we use newer and more sophisticated equipment, like with any other equipment, we need to know its limitations as well. I have encountered many times that newer anesthesiologists would still choose to use a GlideScope/C-MAC when there is severe hemoptysis or lots of secretions without realizing the view of the scope would be obstructed. As a result, this would delay the proper securing of the airway. On the other hand, video laryngoscopy is great for a quick inspection. I always do an endotracheal tube exchange under video laryngoscopy (if not available, at least with a regular laryngoscope) just in case I run into any problems and need to troubleshoot quickly.

# Question 19 (Student #1)

**Question:** Question 19: What is the most common problem with patient monitors? Describe an example from your experience and how the issue was resolved. (Student #1)

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3858/View)

### Response 1 (Kurt Protacio):
In the intensive care unit (ICU), I have been notified almost daily of a problem regarding our patient monitors, whether it is a “faulty” connector, “unable to zero transducer” notifications, or that the patient is in ventricular tachycardia (VT), when, in fact, the patient is stable and the monitor is reading the patient who is ventricular-paced as VT. Overall, the most common monitor issue I have encountered recently is worn connectors.
I have been in patient rooms where a literal “web” of cables and lines were next to the patient’s bed and, due to trips off unit for a scan or coming back from a procedure, the connectors are often stretched, kinked (bent), or disconnected from the patient. Often times, we can troubleshoot by disconnecting the cables momentarily and undoing the entanglement before we reconnect them, hoping that might help solve our connection issues. However, the damage from accumulated wear and tear means having to call medical engineering to replace the worn cables when they no longer work. In addition, during the Covid-19 epidemic, many hospitals have implemented rigorous cleaning and disinfecting processes, which can lead to damage of the device/cables during long term use of high-level disinfectants (Phillips, 2020). Going forward, I have spoken to my manager regarding swapping out cables after the patient has left the room for “fresher” cables and to prevent over-use. Moreover, we have spoken to housekeeping staff to wipe down equipment after disinfecting with hospital-approved cleaning solutions to prevent liquid from destroying the wires and monitors and reducing their quality.
In addition, other common problems with patient monitors that exist include, but are not limited to, distinguishing artifacts from real problems, software customizability (i.e. touchscreen settings, wireless options).

### Response 2 (Deena Kurilsky):
Thank you for sharing your experience with faulty equipment Kurt, I absolutely agree that this is a recurring problem in our facility as well. Worn connectors, in particular, seem to be a persistent issue. It's frustrating when simple tasks, like ensuring proper connections or troubleshooting minor cable issues, become a larger challenge due to the physical deterioration of the equipment over time. 

I can relate to your experience with patient monitors, especially when it comes to cleaning protocols and their impact on equipment functionality. During my time in the operating room we've encountered similar problems—particularly after the first case of the day. After the saturation probes are cleaned and disinfected, we often face issues with the connections, especially if the probes or cables are drenched in cleaning solution. Once they’re damp, they no longer function properly, and we can't get an accurate reading. It's not uncommon for us to have to disconnect and dry out the connections before attempting to use them again. This is particularly problematic when transitioning from one patient to another in the OR on a tight timeline. We can usually tell right away that the saturation probe isn't working properly when we can't visualize the red light on the probe—an immediate indicator that something is off.
 
I wonder if this is common among other facilities?

### Response 3 (Dan Chen):
Hi Kurt and Deena,
Thank you for sharing your experiences—this resonates strongly with what we’re encountering here at SickKids OR. We face similar challenges with patient monitors, especially when it comes to cleaning and cable maintenance. One significant issue is the availability of electronic-safe cleaning wipes. These wipes are not always readily accessible in the rooms, leading staff to use disinfecting wipes that, while effective for general cleaning, can dry out cables and damage electronic screens over time. This contributes significantly to equipment degradation.
Another issue we’ve observed is cables being rolled over or pinched underneath heavy machines, which adds to wear and tear and exacerbates connector problems. In the RT department, we’ve implemented a practice of using cable ties to minimize bunching and tangling, which seems to help maintain cable integrity.
Your point about swapping out cables after patient use to avoid overuse is an excellent strategy and something we’re considering here as well. I also agree that proper communication and training for housekeeping staff about using the right cleaning solutions can help preserve the equipment's quality.
Thank you again for highlighting this issue—it’s helpful to know we’re not alone in tackling these challenges.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks for all your sharing!  
Kurt’s story of a stable ventricular-paced patient showing ventricular tachycardia reminds me of the incident when the pulse oximeter displayed a SpO2 reading when the probe was not even on the patient! Yes, it's very creepy. Both stories remind us that before jumping to a conclusion, we should always look at the patient first and see if the clinical situation matches the monitors’ readings. Inaccurate readings often happen, and they can be due to artifacts, loose connections, or wrong positions.
My most common monitoring problem is the false apneic alarm during procedural sedation. When we perform sedation for transesophageal echo, we provide supplemental oxygen via nasal prongs, allowing us to monitor ETCO2. However, if my patient is a mouth breather, the monitor often gives a false apnea alarm. It is essential to quickly verify whether there is chest rise before doing any head-tilt chin lift, which could have impeded the procedure. Back when I didn’t have the luxury of ETCO2 to monitor my patient’s respiratory rate, I needed to rely on the impedance mode of the ECG. This can also give us a false apnea alarm when the patient takes shallow breaths. In short, it is important to remember that we should treat the patient, not the numbers.
:::
### Response 5 (Janelyne Mandegarian):
Hey everyone, I'm glad that we are not alone in hating this issues with the monitors and connectors. I hate the tangled web of cables and wires on my patient. Its especially difficult to remove if patients like yours are running multiple IV medications and monitors in the room. The most important is to make sure it is not a hazard for the patient like accidentally disconnecting it when moving/removing it and second not a hazard for you IE tripping on the lines. I know ICU nurses and OR nurses are meticulous in general and it definitely extends to the cables and monitors lines. I appreciate that.
I also agree that worn connectors are a nuisance and normally the worst culprit. In procedural sedation with cataracts we see normally 20+ patients a day in each room and our cables are always the first to "fail". The sheer volume we see is the wear and tear of it and we normally have two to three ECG cables and connectors and BP connectors on stand by to switch out quickly from experience. Like Deena said, over saturated lines are annoying, my ECG connectors tend to get over saturated and when I attach the ECG tabs I get artifact that shows "VT" or asystole when it isn't even attached to anyone. If ever that happens I have to switch it out and no point using it further. I leave the cable hanging to try in the sterile core and grab it at the end of the shift and roll it properly without kinking the cables.

### Response 6 (Shawn Page):
Hello,
It's unfortunate that we all seem to have experience with this topic.  Hopefully one day technology will advance even further and we will encounter less and less of these incidents.
Earlier this year all of our slave monitors in one of the cardiac ORs were down for almost 2 weeks.  The only monitor that worked was the screen for anesthesia to see - and no one else could - no one  in the surgical field and neither could the perfusionists.  We have to bring in a (very large) portable screen.  Each surgeon had their own preference for where they wanted the screen.  So every morning we had to remember to check the surgeon assigned, and place the screen where they wanted it.  It was a rough start to the case if we forgot to do this.  It was also challenging because we now had a new addition, and bulky piece of equipment we had to navigate in the room.  There were a few bumped heads and elbows during that period.  It was also challenging for the scrub nurse to now have a new piece of equipment they had to navigate that was sometimes right up against their tables.

### Response 7 (Marjan Nematpour):
Hi Kurt and all ,
Thank you for sharing all of these valuable information and experiences. It is so possible and frustrating to be involve in such a situation which everything seems to work properly but there is a continuous alarm. I just want to add, according to Tscholl et al.(2019), six main topics and 17 sub themes are identified as common problems with patient monitoring reported by anesthesiologists. 
#1: Alarm: including alarm limits and configuration, lack of standardization, in alarm management, requirement for different alarm limit thresholds for different phases of care in a variety of patients, false alarms, too frequently recurring alarm. Anesthesiologists also used the word “alarm fatigue” and stated the risk of desensitization( Tscholl et al.,2019).
#2: Artifacts, caused by electrocautery, patient movement, ignoring this sensor due to frequent artifacts which can lead to a lose of proper decision making for a critical real artifact( Tscholl et al.,2019).
#3: Software, such as number-coded information,interpretation required skills, overloading with information, lack of standardization( Tscholl et al.,2019).
#4: Hardware , such as cable entanglement and worn or bent out plugs, unplugged cables, wet skin or special position leading to ECG electrodes disconnection( Tscholl et al.,2019).
#5: Human factors, such as fatigue and distractions( Tscholl et al.,2019).
#6: System factors, like insufficient standardization between manufacturers( Tscholl et al.,2019).

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3857/View)

### Response 1 (Dong Yue Yu):
Patient care monitor is the most frequent use equipment in the intensive care unit (ICU), it directly and indirectly provide us real-time data on patients' vital signs and hemodynamic status. However, we run into false alarms at daily basis depends on patient conditions and scenarios.
For example, Cardiac Rhythm related false alarm, false ventricular tachycardia (VT) , asystole, ventricular fibrillation,90% were determined to be false positive according to Pelter et al.(2023). VT is the most common one because the alarm occurs in patients with bundle branch block (BBB); ventricular paced rhythms, atrial fibrillation waveforms. It is a lethal arrhythmia, this type of alarm cannot be silence at setting, so the nurse requires to physically silence the alarms at monitor each time it alarms, each alarm will silence for 2 minute and restart alarming again. It creates problem cause nurse fatigue. 
The other issues is the artifacts cause of loose connection of the electrode to body when is wet, attach to hairy chest, incorrect placements, cable malfunction, and artifact caused from external equipment that are too close to cardiac monitor.
Since it is quite common for patient with pacemaker, atrial fibrillation in critical care unit, this kind of alarming because the similarities of waveforms, the monitor unable to analyze and providing more information because the current arrhythmia algorithm used in the monitor manufactures were created more than 30 years ago and with only two ECG leads, very outdated and small amount of database. The only solution is to update the equipment at their manufactory level. At the meantime, from a nursing prospective, we could we could STANDARDIZE our care by change the electrode at each shift, maintain the electrode dry and intact, avoid to place on hairy chest area or any bony area to ensure proper conduction, make this intervention as high priority as other nursing activities at the beginning of our shift. Attach to 12- lead electrode for high risk patients, so a 12-Lead can be performed immediately by press the 12-lead feature to help us identify the real or false positive alarm. Moreover, ensure the accurate connection and accuracy of other vital signs which can help us to differentiate a true or false alarm simultaneously when we are unable to attend monitor at bedside immediately. When the patient is on isolation and donning PPE require extra time.  
Pelter et al. (2023) suggested that 10% of true alarms event were missed because of  the commonly occurring false alarms. Therefore, if we can reducing modifiable false alarm, reduce alarm induced fatigue can potentially increase the accuracy of missed true alarm event and ensure patient safety.

### Response 2 (Teresa Nguyen):
Hi Dong Yue, 
 
Thanks for highlighting a common issue that is seen in the Intensive Care Unit. I agree that false alarming may cause nurse fatigue. I personally have felt this in my practice. In my own experience, it takes away valuable time from patient care (as sometimes I find myself in my other patient’s room performing nursing care and must stop to check on my first patient who is falsely alarming). 
 
One study by Drews (2008), explored another common issue amoung nurses: the monitor’s complex display combined with the lack of training, contributed to many nurses not knowing how to adjust alarm parameters. This caused nurses to lean towards using the default alarm settings (Drews, 2008). An example of this is that at my current hospital, patient A has COPD and received physician orders to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) levels at 88-92%. However, a newer nurse did not adjust the alarm settings causing it to alarm when the patient’s SpO2 was at 88%. I educated her about the patient’s medical history of COPD contributing to his SpO2 of 88% and suggesting to lower the parameters so that it would alarm at 86% rather than 88%. 
 
Considering the prevalence of alarm fatigue and its impact on not only nurses, but patient safety as well, do you believe we could use staff support (e.g. Personal Support Worker, nursing extern, or ICU manager) or even patients’ families to respond to alarms or check in on the patient?

Hi April and Teresa,
Thanks for the reminder on the importance of setting up our monitors properly.  A lot of the monitoring errors can easily be prevented if we pay just a bit more attention to our setup and optimize it the best way we can.  As an anesthesiologist I work with often says, “Garbage-in, Garbage-out.”  Monitoring will only be helpful if we use it properly, starting with setting up correctly, applying it to the appropriate location, and setting appropriate alarm limits.

# Question 2

**Question:** Question 2: Operating room employees are potentially at risk for exposure to inhaled anesthetic agents. Explain this statement and give specific criteria that must be followed according to CSA standards.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3879/View)

### Response 1 (Reneerose Ong):
Operating room (OR) employees are at risk of exposure to inhaled anesthetic agents due to their use in surgeries for maintaining anesthesia.  OR pollution is defined as any anesthetic gas that is freely circulating in the air during a procedure involving an anesthetic (Dunington, 2019)
 
Prolonged or repeated exposure to OR pollution and / or waste anesthetic gases is a health hazard to healthcare professionals. Chronic exposure to nitrous oxide and volatile agents has been linked to headaches, nausea, and in some cases, chronic respiratory or fertility issues (miscarriages or spontaneous abortion), liver disease, cancer, renal failure, aplastic anemia, congenital defects etc. (Dunington, 2019).
To minimize these risks, protocols and standards are set by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA), focusing on waste anesthetic gas management and proper ventilation.
 
 
**Key CSA Criteria for Exposure Control: **

- CSA Recommended Levels for OR pollution: (Dunington, 2019)

N2O < 25 parts per million (ppm)
Volatile Agents < 2 ppm
 

- **Gas scavenging systems (GSS)**: 

Collects and removes waste anesthetic gases released from equipment and patient exhalation during anesthesia to prevent exposure of operating room personnel and reduce combustion risks (Dunington, 2019). Necessary due to excess fresh gas flow rates that often deliver additional anesthetic agents, nitrous oxide, and oxygen, all of which need safe disposal through scavenging (Weston, 2023)
 
The CSA specifies that leakage from scavenging systems should not exceed 100 mL/min under expected pressures (e.g., 5 cmH₂O), ensuring minimal environmental contamination (Dunington, 2019).
 

- **Patient safety system and Performance requirements**: (Dunington, 2019)

- Scavenging systems should not increase resistance to patient expiration by more than 0.5 cm H₂O at 30 L/min and 5.0 cm H₂O at 90 L/min
- In the event of a blockage/ obstruction, the scavenging system must not cause more than a 10 cm H₂O increase in expiratory resistance at 30 L/min, protecting patient safety
- Pressure within the scavenging device should not drop below -0.5 cmH2O – to ensure safe operation without excess vacuum

 

- **Monitoring and reporting requirements**: (Dunington, 2019)

- CSA limits leakage to <100 mL/min at normal operating pressure (5 cmH2O) – limits gas exposure in workplace** **
- Every 4 months, healthcare facilities must monitor exposure to waste anesthetic gases, including airflow patterns and personnel exposure according to CSA and Ontario Ministry of Labour
- When nitrous oxide is used in the OR, nitrous oxide monitoring represents the adequacy of scavenging

 
**         Key Monitoring Areas**:

- **Leaks and OR pollution levels**: Check and monitor before and during procedures
- **"Hot Spots"**: Identify areas of high exposure
- **Time Weighted Averages**: Measure exposure over time (#ppm/hr)
- **Ceiling Exposure Values**: Track maximum exposure at any given time
- **Short-Term Exposure Values**: Monitor maximum exposure within a 15-minute window

 

- **Ventilation**: (Dunington, 2019)

Proper ventilation in the OR is essential to dilute and remove anesthetic gases from the air: 

- prevent anesthetic gases from stagnating
- provide a continuous flow of fresh air
- ensure a pathway for the safe disposal of waste gases

 
Factors Influencing Airflow:

- Airflow rate and pattern (hot spots may increase pollution levels)
- Gas leakage site and rate
- Equipment and furniture placement
- Movement of personnel
- Pathway for disposal

 
The CSA recommends maintaining at least 20 air changes per hour for all operating rooms, with appropriate exhaust systems to prevent accumulation.
 
By adhering to these CSA criteria, hospitals can significantly reduce the risk of anesthetic gas exposure for OR employees, enhancing workplace safety and health outcomes.

### Response 2 (Laryssa Hartmann):
Hi Reneerose,

Your post is a great detailed overview of the health risks associated with exposure to waste anesthetic gases in the operating room and the necessary steps for minimizing these risks. I completely agree that it’s essential to follow standards like those set by the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) to protect OR staff form harmful exposure. 
 
Building on this, I think there is an opportunity to expand on how these systems can improve the tracking and monitoring of long-term health outcomes related to waste anesthetic gas exposure. Are there systems in place to monitor chronic health conditions that could be linked to prolonged exposure? This type of data could further emphasize the significance of adhering to the safety protocols, such as those set by the CSA. For example, a recent study by Al-Rasheedi et al. (2021) evaluated the effects of waste anesthetic gases on immune function and oxidative stress among hospital staff, with a focus on those working in operating rooms. The study found that anesthesiologists showed significantly higher levels of immune makers and oxidative stress compared to other healthcare workers (Al-Rasheedi et al, 2021). These findings suggest that exposure to waste anesthetic gases could potentially compromise the immune system and increase vulnerability to various health issues. The study concluded that operating room staff are at risk of immunotoxicity and recommended the implementation of education programs to minimize exposure to waste anesthetic gases (Al-Rasheedi et al, 202). This highlights the need for continuous efforts to ensure the effectiveness of anesthetic gas management systems, alongside CSA standards to minimize these health risk.

### Response 3 (Junia Isaac):
Thank you both for your detailed and insightful posts on the risks of waste anesthetic gas exposure and the importance of CSA standards. You’ve brought up critical points about monitoring, health risks, and mitigation strategies that highlight the need for stringent adherence to safety protocols in the OR.
** **
Reneerose, your explanation of CSA standards and the role of gas scavenging systems (GSS) in minimizing OR pollution was thorough and well-structured. I found your discussion on “hot spots” and ventilation systems, including the recommendation of 20 air changes per hour, particularly relevant (Dunington, 2019). Building on this, could newer technologies like real-time air quality monitors or wearable exposure sensors further enhance detection and intervention for OR staff? These tools could provide actionable data to address high-risk areas and individual exposure trends.
 
Additionally, you highlighted ventilation as key to reducing pollution. Do you think increasing the air change rate above the CSA standard might further protect staff during lengthy surgeries with high anesthetic gas flow rates? Exploring whether such adjustments are feasible in high-risk scenarios could be valuable.
** **
Laryssa, your discussion on chronic health outcomes and the findings from Al-Rasheedi et al. (2021) adds an important layer to this conversation. The link between prolonged exposure to anesthetic gases and oxidative stress is concerning and underscores the need for robust monitoring systems. Could hospitals implement mandatory health screenings or biomarkers of exposure for OR staff, similar to protocols used in other industries handling hazardous substances?
 
You also mentioned the role of education in mitigating risks. Expanding on this, what are your thoughts on integrating advanced gas recycling systems to reduce both workplace exposure and environmental impact? Such innovations could align with sustainability goals while enhancing staff safety.
** **
Both of your posts emphasize the importance of monitoring and adherence to CSA standards. They’ve also encouraged me to consider how hospitals could better integrate pollution control into broader safety and environmental initiatives. A national registry tracking long-term exposure outcomes, as well as adopting technologies like wearable monitors and advanced ventilation systems, could further enhance workplace safety and inform policy changes.

### Response 4 (Dan Chen):
Hi Renee,
Your post provides an excellent overview of the risks associated with waste anesthetic gas exposure and its safety guidelines. You’ve clearly highlighted the standards for scavenging systems, monitoring protocols, and the role of proper ventilation in minimizing OR pollution. Thank you Laryssa, for the pointing out the importance of long-term monitoring systems for tracking chronic health outcomes related to waste anesthetic gas exposure. The study you mentioned highlights the risks of immune system compromise and increased oxidative stress among operating room staff due to anesthetic gas exposure, emphasizing the need for adherence to safety protocols and education.
To add to both of your points, it’s worth emphasizing how practices during specific procedures can exacerbate OR pollution. For example, during oral surgeries, particularly at SickKids, anesthetists often need to disconnect and reconnect the breathing circuit from the endotracheal tube (ETT) or laryngeal mask airway (LMA) based on the surgeon's request. This frequent manipulation, especially during mask induction, can lead to significant gas leakage into the OR environment, further contributing to pollution levels. This concern aligns with findings from a study comparing waste anesthetic gas concentrations during different induction methods. The study noted that inhaled inductions with a rebreathing bag or a circle circuit often exceeded the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended exposure limits of 2 ppm for sevoflurane and 50 ppm for nitrous oxide, with peak concentrations frequently reaching 20 ppm sevoflurane and 100 ppm nitrous oxide during induction. Even during maintenance with LMA ventilation, exposure levels frequently exceeded the recommended 2-ppm ceiling for sevoflurane (Hoerauf et al., 1999). This demonstrates that inhaled induction techniques inherently result in higher anesthetic gas exposure compared to intravenous methods such as propofol or thiopental, which generally kept waste gas levels below recommended limits.
Given these findings, special attention should be paid to mitigating exposure risks, particularly for vulnerable individuals (e.g., women of childbearing age) and in scenarios where circuit disconnections further exacerbate gas leakage. Enhancing scavenging systems, reinforcing staff education on circuit handling techniques, and implementing real-time ambient gas monitoring could help reduce these risks.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Renee, for reminding us of the different waste anesthetic gas management guidelines.
Adding to the minimum of 20 air exchanges/hour, the Canadian Anesthesiologists’ Society guidelines recommend a non-circulating system in all operating rooms. Air recirculation is not permitted when operations are being performed and is not recommended at any other time either. To be more energy efficient, I understand that some institutions use a non-circulating system during the day and a re-circulating system at night when there are no operations. However, if there is ever a need to do an emergency operation at night, it should be switched back to a non-circulating system. 
As Laryssa indicated the health hazards of chronic exposure, to enhance our workplace safety, it is crucial for us to practice good anesthetic techniques. Our practices can directly impact inhaled anesthetics pollution, as Dan pointed out. Each of us can prevent waste gas pollution by practicing good anesthetic techniques, such as taking care during filling vaporizers to avoid spillage and overspills. What other anesthetic techniques can we use to prevent waste gas pollution?
Lastly, I want to add that waste gas pollution is not only limited to within the operating rooms. To prevent pollution in PACU from the patient’s exhaled gases, it is important to wash anesthetic agents into the breathing circuit with oxygen for an adequate period before extubation and/or before transferring the patient to PACU.

### Response 1 (Adrian Harris):
In 1935, the Boeing Corporation built an advanced prototype Boeing aircraft that was designed to fly faster and farther than airplanes had flown before. During its’ maiden flight, it crashed on takeoff causing significant loss of life.  The cause of the crash was human error: one switch that hadn’t been flipped by the pilots before getting airborne.  In response to the crash, Boeing created a simple solution for their next aircraft: checklists for pilots to follow before taxi, takeoff and landing, to ensure consistency and safety.  Checklists quickly became the new standard in the aviation world (1). 
 
Almost 75 years later, the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted the checklist-style safety system to help improve the worldwide rate of surgical complications.  WHO estimated they could reduce human error and save half a million lives a year by implementing a safety checklist worldwide (2).
 
Figure 1 below shows the original version of the WHO Surgical Safety Checklist (SSC) created in 2009.  As part of a project by WHO, the SSC was reviewed in a study by eight hospitals in eight countries, including the University Health Network (UHN) here in Toronto.  The study found that the checklist had effectively reduced the rate of surgical complications by 36% (3).  After the study results were published by WHO, it took less than 4 years for the surgical checklist to become standardized and implemented in operating rooms around the world (2). Fun fact: UHN implemented the first surgical safety checklist in Canada (3)!
 

Figure 1. The original SSC developed by the World Health Organization in 2009 (4)
 
The fundamentals of the SSC are three checklists, each matching a phase of the patient’s operating room journey: the sign-in or briefing (before induction), the time out (before skin incision) and the sign-out or debriefing (before the patient leaves the operating room (OR)) (3). 
 
Within Canada, the SSC was adopted by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute (CPSI) and with the assistance of UHN, it was redesigned for context and approved by a working group of Canadian OR personnel and human factors professionals (3). Shown below in Figure 2, the CPSI SSC was promoted and then quickly implemented in ORs across the country (3).  Last year in Ontario between July and December, 99.7% of every single surgery had a surgical checklist completed (5). 
 
 

Figure 2. The Canadian surgical safety checklist, adapted from WHO, 2009 (4)
 
Each hospital now uses their own version of the safety checklist with the three phases of the patient’s operative journey, very similar to the one shown in Figure 2. 
 
At the institution where I work, there are individual laminated copies of the SSC available in each OR for any personnel to hold, read aloud and follow, to make the process of completing the checklist easier. When I was in the OR recently, I had a chance to hear each section of the SSC reviewed.  
 
Using the CPSI version as a basis, following adaptations were made to their checklist (6):
 
Step 1: Briefing
 

- Each discipline is expected to confirm their own checklist items (e.g. surgeon, anesthesia or designate and nursing) and these items are organized on the SSC under their respective discipline name; this easy-to-follow format ensures each discipline’s voice is heard, and any concerns can be heard by the entire team (6)
- When patients are awake and able to participate for the briefing, the surgeon will usually ask the patient to self-identify with their name, date of birth and the proposed procedure. The circulating RN will then verify the patient’s armband to confirm identity
- PPE requirements and COVID status is an added checklist item (6)

 
Step 2: Time-Out 
 

- This has been rebranded as a “surgical pause” (6)
- I have often heard a statement out loud by the surgeon if there are any other questions or concerns, as the very last item before the surgical incision; to adapt when there’s been an emergent induction and need for quick skin incision, it’s usually more of a “Are we good to go ahead?” 

 
Step 3: Debriefing 
 

- This checklist has been further clarified that is performed after extubation and before the patient leaves the room (6)
- Once again, it is organized by discipline, for each to review aloud their respective items one at time; additionally, any post-op consults are reviewed by anesthesia or their designate
- The very last item of the SSC is for Nursing to confirm whether anything could have been done to make the case safer (6); while this question is integral to a culture of continuous improvement in patient safety, the reality exists that there is a serious time-crunch between cases to turn over the room; I wonder if this item is more often addressed when sufficient time permits or perhaps well after the case 

 
Just like in the aviation industry, the operating room environment doesn’t come without its’ risks.  But with the implementation of checklists in the OR (and it seems like they’re showing up into other areas like critical care or emergency/trauma care), we can continue to minimize the human risk factor component of patient safety management.

### Response 2 (Kelly Gram):
Very thorough post Adrian thank you!  And interesting to read. I love the comparison between the airline industry and healthcare. The overhaul of the airline industry has had many positive impacts on healthcare and I find it fascinating to learn about.  I've been in the OR early in my career before the safety checklists were implemented, and thinking back comparing it to the current environment, it's hard to believe how independent the services were of one another when working on the same patient , really only communicating once things went wrong. 
In my current role in the regional block room, we do the briefing in there as the patients receive sedatives for the blocks and thus are not able to legally participate in a briefing held after that. During my first week, I had no idea how formal this process was, and one of the surgeons went ahead and did the briefing without the OR nurse present. This nurse was incredibly upset and made quite a stink about it.  It seemed a little over the top to me at the time, but I learned from that and from that point forward made sure that a nurse, surgeon, anesthesiologist or designate was always present for briefings. It's taken me a little time to truly appreciate the importance of the briefings and how it ensures the entire team is on the same page from surgical concerns to anesthetist concerns, someone from every service in the room is aware of the plan and any expected complications. 
From a patient standpoint, I find it quite amusing to see their responses when they are asked the same questions by multiple different people especially what surgery they're having and on what side. Often times patients are disconcerted at the thought we may not know what we're doing, or that we haven't read their chart, but once I tell them our process and reason multiple staff ask the same questions is just multiple layers of safety, they understand and are often appreciative of the process. We even sometimes joke about making sure they don't wake up with the wrong knee/hip/shoulder done, but the reality is that this has happened in the past. It's such a simple process and  normal part of our routine now its hard to believe these briefings weren't always in place.   I wonder what new safety measures will be implemented in the next ten or twenty years, and we'll be saying the same thing again? It'll probably involve AI though ;)

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Adrian, for an in-depth post, including the historical background of the CPSI checklist.
Utilizing a surgical safety checklist seems to be a no-brainer, but there are barriers to its implementation and continual compliance. The biggest barrier is the feeling of time constraint. As Adrian mentioned, University Health Network was one of the test sites for the WHO checklist. I remember some opposition to performing the checklist initially because of the extra time required. However, it really only takes about a couple of minutes to complete the checklist. Since then, in addition to the time-out before skin incision, we added additional time-outs in our 2021 revision, such as a change in the orientation of the OR table, a change in patient draping, a change in the surgical team, etc.
We perform a surgical checklist for all surgical procedures, including small procedural sedation cases such as cataract removal. In fact, sometimes, the anesthesia assistants lead the time-out process in these cases. Therefore, it is very important for us to be aware of the different elements of the checklist. Recently, I was so pleased to learn that the anesthesia assistant is actually mentioned in Sunnybrook’s checklist together with the anesthesiologist! 😊

Hi Adrain,
thank you for your post.  a safety checklist is essential at every medical procedures to ensure patient safety. Any documents poses risks of wrong information. with the newer ID and epic system, scanning become the first steps for every treatments, however, it is still important to ask the patient to verbalize their name, location of surgery, allergies and relevant inforamtion if possible to elimiante medication errors.  For patients with difficulties. 2 registed staff requird to identify patient and confirm information.

### Response 1 (Shawn Page):
For a few months last year we kept having flow sensor failures, liquid build up in the circuits and inspiratory and expiratory flow circuits, and a few times found mold in the flow sensors. During cases we would receive flow related alarms i.e. Vt not met, Low/high flow alarms, ET Control alarms.
We were using clear, circle circuits, with a bacterial filter between each end of the circuit and the flow sensors. The circuits were changed at end of day daily,  and filters were always changed between cases. Flow sensors were changed once a week.
First, we switched to pick antibacterial circuits that were then changed daily, continued with the change of filters between cases.  The moisture, alarms and mold continued.  
Then at the end of day, instead of connecting new circuits and new filters to the machine, we connected filters only.  We found some attendants were connecting a new circuit and filter and attaching the pt end of the circuit to the compliance and leak plug on the AGM, therefore not allowing fresh air access to the flow sensors. So to ensure this stopped happening, filters only were attached, and the new circuit was left in the bag and on the AGM.  This did not help the problem.
We had reps for the AGM come in and they told us that despite having other organizations with high use like we do, they have never encountered this problem.  They made a suggestion, and we followed it.  We now change the flow sensors daily.  This allows for each flow sensor to have a 24 hour period, where they are not in use, and have them sit in atmosphere and be allowed to fully air dry out.  We continue to NOT attach the new circuit at end of day, to further allow for fresh air to reach the flow sensors.
We no longer have this problem.  As a team, we believe the daily changing of the flow sensors has had the greatest positive impact on this situation,

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Hi Shawn,
I also have a fair share of problems with the flow sensor as well. The culprit is our dear friend, moisture.  The advantages of rebreathing in a circle circuit can also cause problems such as condensation, especially in longer cases. This can impair airflow and can completely block the flow of the side-stream ETCO2 sampling line. The solution is to simply change the sample line and water trap. A bigger problem is when water reaches the flow sensor, which leads to erroneous readings. In this case, we will need to swap out the flow sensor located proximal to the expiratory and inspiratory outlets. Luckily, it has not required us to change the flow sensor daily. However, it is still important to know the location of spare supplies and the location of some problematic components in the AGM.
The other common problem I have is leaks.  Read my reply to Teresa’s post.

### Response 1 (Teresa Nguyen):
Clinicians may face various issues while using the anesthesia gas machine. The following list presents common problems that one may face and ways to troubleshoot: 

**(1) Electrical Issues **

- 
Turn the master switch on/off and ensure all associated electrical equipment is functioning 

- 
Confirm oxygen (O2) flowmeter has a flow of 50-200 mL and ensure O2 flow control valve is off

- 
Ensure anesthesia machine is connected to an electrical outlet 

- 
Ensure the battery has a 30-minute back up supply and is charging while the machine is being used

- 
Check that physiological monitors are functioning (blood pressure, end tidal capnography, pulse oximeter) and adjust alarm parameters 

- 
Verify that all equipment is leak-free and there are no kinks 

- 
Verify that the gas sampling line is connected to the airway filter 

- 
Calibrate the O2 analyzer to read 21% at room air 

- 
While the O2 source is from the gas cylinder (and not the pipeline), open the O2 flow control valve and connect the analyzer to the common gas outlet (CGO), and calibrate it to read at least 95% 

**(2) No Gas Output **

- 
O2 or nitrous oxide (N2O) supply is low OR pressure is low 

- 
Check pressure gauge 

- 
Check for gas supply in the cylinder or line

- 
In the high-pressure section: O2 cylinder should be at least half full (~1000 psi) and N2O cylinder should read 750 psi

- 
Confirm that the gas cylinders are properly attached to the machine via hanger yoke assembly

- 
Restore supply if necessary 

**(3) O2 Alarm Failure **

- 
Either the alarm is faulty or the alarm battery needs to be replaced 

**(4) Machine Leakage **

- 
Examine tubing or flow valve seals and gasket for leak 

- 
Observe if there are any loose connections 

- 
Ensure that the O2 pipeline is connected to the O2 wall outlet and the N2O pipeline is connected to the N2O wall outlet using the coupler system. One can perform the “tug test” as correct coupling will allow the pipelines to attach properly and not disconnect when the clinician “tugs” on it 

**(5) Flow meter Fault **

- 
Check that the needle valve is working properly (ensure it is not damaged or stuck) 

- 
Examine if the float/ball is stuck (this would give an inaccurate reading of the flowmeter) 

- 
Lastly, replace the flowmeter if necessary 

(Goneppanavar & Prabhu, 2013; Mathur, 2023) 

**Example: **

An issue that I had observed was due to a leak in the breathing circuit. At my hospital, we use corrugating breathing circuit tubing as part of the anesthesia gas machine. On one particular case, patient A received general anesthesia and was experiencing fluctuating end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) levels and lower-than-expected O2 saturation levels ranging from 89-92%. 

First, we checked the placement of the endotracheal tube (ETT) to ensure it was still in the correct position. There were no issues with the ETT placement. Next, we began to troubleshoot the corrugated breathing circuit. We identified a leak where the breathing tube connects to the ETT. Although it was a minor leak, it was significant enough to affect the delivery of gases as well as the patient’s ventilation.

To resolve the issue, one of the AAs who was circulating in the OR grabbed a brand new breathing circuit from the supply area. The OR team coordinated effectively with each other: one staff member manually ventilated the patient using a bag-valve mask, while the other member quickly replaced the old breathing tube with the new one. After the defective part was disposed, we attached the patient back onto the gas machine and continued to monitor all vital signs, keeping a closer eye on ETCO2 and O2 saturation levels. The rest of the case finished smoothly and there were no complications with the gas machine. The patient’s vital signs remained relatively stable for the remaining portion of the procedure. 

To summarize, in order to resolve the issue at hand, the OR staff quickly worked together as a team - first observing that the physiological monitors provided abnormal readings (ETCO2 and SpO2). The second step was to begin troubleshooting immediately, beginning from the ETT towards the gas machine. Lastly, communication and teamwork were large factors in resolving this issue. One member was assigned to retrieve the new breathing tube. Another member manually ventilated the patient as another staff quickly replaced the breathing circuit - wasting no time. In the OR, effective time management is quite important as the more efficient the staff are, the more procedures and surgeries can be completed. 

That day, I observed how cohesively the OR team worked together and how efficient their communication was amoung each other.

Hi Teresa,
Thank you for your posts, I agree with you on the team cohesiveness in the OR. Duiring my obervation day, I noticed how effectively they are working as a team, with surgeon, assistant, nurses and anesthesiologist. the work-flow so smooth and waste no time.  it is simiiar like a code situtaion where everyone assume certain rule automaticlly, the whole complicated situation become clear and organized to proceed with protocols or related actions to ensure patient safety.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks for sharing your experience.
I can use 2 words to sum up my problems with the gas machines – moisture and leaks. Read my post replying to Shawn’s on the problems with moisture.
Regarding leaks, one of the culprits is the CO2 canister. The leaks either come from not latching well or the cracks on the canister. The most interesting case was the dust on the O-ring of the CO2 canister, causing a leak. I remember changing the CO2 canister several times and still could not pass the gas machine’s leak test. The Biomed specialist and I finally detached the CO2 canister and cleaned the O-rings with a cotton swab. When we reattached the CO2 canister, it finally passed.  
Another source of leaks is the bellows. Not long ago, we received a departmental email about the recurrent incidents with the bellows assembly leaks causing issues with starting mechanical ventilation.  We found out that a sudden or sustained impact with significant force at a key location on the bellows dome will depress the latch, fastening the rim of the bellows in place so that the rim is released. It is difficult to observe because the latch springs back into place after the impact, even though the rim has become detached. The impact can be from patient stretcher and other excess equipment that are crammed next to the machine.

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Hi Marjan, 
Thanks for highlighting the abbreviated checks that must be completed before each anesthetic procedure.
According to the CAS guidelines, a complete full gas machine check is required daily before the first case of the day or when the gas machine has been moved or vaporizers changed, as you mentioned.  We often have more than one surgical procedure in the same operating room. After completing the full check, we can perform an abbreviated check before the start of each subsequent case. The rationale for the abbreviated check is that the full check has already confirmed that the gas machine is working properly with no internal leaks. Therefore, we won’t need to verify the gas supply or the scavenging system after the daily full check. The subsequent checks need only to confirm the functionality of any disposable equipment connected to the machine after the full check (patient breathing circuit, suction liner, end-tidal tubing, etc.) and refill any consumables (vaporizer, CO2 absorbent, airway equipment, drugs, etc.).
I agree that we need to do a pressure leak test on any newly connected patient breathing circuit because looking for leaks visually is insufficient. You shared that we can use the gas machine’s electric circuit testing option. Another option is to do a quick manual circuit pressure leak test.  Can anyone review the steps of how a manual circuit pressure leak test is done?
Recently, the University Health Network changed to the Silver Knight breathing circuits that allow for a 7-day circuit change schedule. Obviously, we will use a new filter between patients and also change the circuits if they get soiled or are used on a known infectious case. This change may reduce the leak test that needs to be performed. 
Just curious, what type of breathing circuits are everyone using at their institution (one-time use disposable, 7-day use disposable, or reusable)?

### Response 3 (Marjan Nematpour):
Hi Phoebe, 
Thank you for your precious feedback . To answer your question, I found this short YouTube video helpful for the quick manual circuit pressure leak test and attached it here. Also, in our centre in electrophysiology lab we change the patient breathing circuit , suction liner and End-Tidal tubing between cases as per cardiac group protocol and policy, however, I am not sure if Anesthesia team follow the same protocol in operating room or not. 
Best Regards ,
Marjan

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Paula, for the overview of the routine maintenance of the anesthesia gas machine.
The maintenance of anesthesia gas machines is usually shared between OR respiratory therapists, anesthesia assistants, OR technicians, and the biomedical department. As Paula mentioned, different checks are performed daily, weekly, monthly, and annually to ensure the functioning of measuring and safety components, as well as test leakages due to wear and tear. Obviously, these tests will be different depending on machine models and institutions.
Some examples of tasks that could be done by OR respiratory therapists, anesthesia assistants, and OR technicians are daily machine checks and weekly maintenance, which may include calibrating the oxygen analyzer sensor or completely shutting off or rebooting the whole anesthesia gas machine to prevent issues with electronic software. Monthly maintenance may consist of emptying the water trap of the CO2 absorber. 
We also have annual preventative maintenance performed by our biomedical department. We purchase extra gas machines as spares so biomedical specialists can pull out gas machines from service to perform the required maintenance throughout the year. In addition, vaporizers may need to be sent back to the manufacturer for service and calibration.
We can all appreciate that maintaining an anesthesia gas machine is a massive undertaking.

# Question 7

**Question:** Question 7: Describe the pumping effect and pressurizing effect of intermittent back pressure on vaporizers.

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3873/View)

### Response 1 (Ryan Christopher Floro):
**Vaporizers: Overview**
 
               Vaporizers are typically a variable bypass design that is temperature and pressure compensated. In this system, fresh gas flow bifurcates into (1) bypass that goes to the outlet and (2) the reservoir where anesthetic vapour is taken up. These bifurcations then meet at the outlet after the desired concentration is set by the control dial. The combined gas then proceeds to the rest of the circuit for patient delivery (Weston, 2023). See below for a diagram from Weston (2023).
 

 
 
**Pumping Effect**
 
               As shown in the diagram above, the section of the vaporizer containing the anesthetic gas is larger than the bypass section where there is only fresh gas flow. When back pressure is applied into the system, more fresh gas flow enters the section with the anesthetic, picking up more vapour than usual. Once the back pressure from the system is relieved, the vapour-containing gas proceeds through the outlet like normal. However, because of the temporary increase in pressure, the vapour-containing gas expands into the vapour-free bypass section where the pressure had become lower. This is then carried to the outlet, increasing the concentration of anesthetic gas delivered to the patient.
 
               The pumping effect is minimized when outlet resistance is increased and can be eliminated altogether if a one-way valve is used in the outlet channel, similar to what is shown in the diagram above. If the one-way valve is not present, the pumping effect will have a greater effect on final concentrations when low flows are used (Dhulkhed et al., 2013). The diagram shown below shows the point during the pumping effect where the extra vapour-containing gas enters the bypass channel (Saneesh, 2016).
 

 
**Pressurizing Effect**
** **
**               **This effect with backpressure is seen instead with higher flows where the fresh gas instead builds up in the chamber. Additional vapour in this case is not added to the gas flow and is instead diluted at the outlet. This means that when the pressure is released, the increased amount of fresh gas mixed with the same amount of concentration leads to a less concentrated mixture of anesthetic gas being delivered to the patient (Dhulkhed et al., 2013). This could have implications such as under-sedating the patient or causing awareness during a procedure.

### Response 2 (Junia Isaac):
Thank you Ryan for providing such a clear and detailed explanation of the pumping and pressurizing effects on vaporizers! I really appreciate how you incorporated diagrams and referenced multiple sources to illustrate these concepts effectively. Your discussion highlights an important aspect of vaporizer function, particularly how intermittent backpressure can influence the anesthetic concentration delivered to patients.
 
Building on your points, I’d like to explore how modern vaporizer designs address these effects beyond the one-way valve you mentioned. For example, Weston (2023) discusses how newer variable bypass vaporizers are equipped with pressure-dampening mechanisms to minimize fluctuations caused by intermittent backpressure. These innovations ensure greater stability in anesthetic delivery, particularly under conditions of fluctuating flow rates. Have you encountered any specific models or systems that incorporate these features, and if so, how effective do you think they are in real-world applications?
 
Additionally, I’d like to delve deeper into the potential clinical implications of these effects. While you mentioned that the pumping effect could lead to an increased anesthetic concentration and the pressurizing effect could cause under-sedation, it’s worth considering how these fluctuations might impact specific patient populations, such as those undergoing procedures with low-flow anesthesia. Studies suggest that low-flow anesthesia amplifies the impact of vaporizer inconsistencies. Low fresh gas flows can magnify inconsistencies in vaporizer output due to reduced buffering effects in the breathing circuit. This can impact the precise delivery of volatile anesthetics, particularly if the equipment lacks advanced compensatory mechanisms (Hendrickx et al., 2002). What strategies would you recommend to mitigate these effects, particularly when using older machines in low-resource settings where modern technology might not be available?
 
Overall, your post provides an excellent framework for understanding these complex phenomena. Thank you for prompting such a valuable discussion, and I look forward to your thoughts on these additional considerations!

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Ryan, for an excellent overview of the impact of intermittent back pressure on the anesthetic output concentration. The pumping effect is usually associated with a low fresh gas flow rate, whereas the pressurizing effect is with a high gas flow rate. Generally, the changes in the anesthetic output caused by the pumping effect are usually more significant than the pressurizing effect.
The one-way valve is an effective way to prevent both effects.
In addition to a one-way valve, there are other ways to mitigate the pumping effect. As Ryan mentioned, the vaporizer is usually larger than the bypass chamber, causing more fresh gas flow to enter the vaporizer chamber, get saturated, and cause an increase in the concentration of the anesthetic mixture. One solution is either increasing the bypass chamber's size or decreasing the vaporizing chamber's size. This way, fresh gas flow is less likely to enter the vaporizing chamber. 
Another solution is to have a longer vaporizer inlet tubing with more twists and bends. The inlet tubing acts as a reservoir, absorbing the increased gas flow during the intermittent back pressure. This way, when the intermittent back pressure is released, the extra gas in the vaporizing chamber expands in the inlet tubing and does not reach the bypass chamber. The old Drager Vapor 19.1 uses this method to protect from the pumping effect.

# Question 8

**Question:** Question 8: Which Mapleson breathing circuit is most efficient with spontaneous ventilation and with controlled ventilation? Describe the Bain circuit. What are its advantages and disadvantages?

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3871/View)

### Response 1 (Laryssa Hartmann):
**Mapleson Breathing Circuits **
The Mapleson breathing circuits are classified into several types, commonly labeled A through F, based on the arrangement of the components, each has varying efficiency in terms of spontaneous ventilation and controlled ventilation (Meier & Cadogan, 2024). (Fig 1) Showcasing the various modifications of the Mapleson breathing circuits. 

(Meier & Cadogan, 2024).
**Most Efficient Mapleson Circuits:**
** **

- Controlled Ventilation 

 

- Mapleson D, circuit is typically considered the most efficient for controlled ventilation. In this circuit, the fresh gas flow is directed into the circuit in a way that minimizes dead space while ensuring that the system effectively removes Co2, from the patient during positive pressure ventilation. The Mapleson D circuit is preferred when positive-pressure ventilation is needed because the reservoir bag is positioned to provide an adequate volume of air for controlled ventilation (Garret & Stahl, 2023).  

 

- Spontaneous Ventilation 

 

- The Mapleson A circuit (also called Magill system) is generally considered the most efficient for spontaneous ventilation. This is because the patient’s exhaled gas is scavenged or vented, and the fresh gas flow is directed to the patient in a way that minimizes dead space and rebreathing of exhaled gases. This circuit is designed to allow for the maximum delivery of fresh gas while removing the exhaled CO2 (Giordano & Gravenstein, 1993). 
- Disadvantages: Wastage of gases, OR pollution, mechanical ventilator should not be used with this circuit because the entire system becomes dead space, incorrect manufacturing or assembling of the circuit, can result in increase dead space (Kaul & Mittal, 2013). 

 

- Pediatric patients 

 

- The Mapleson E circuit is generally considered the most efficient for pediatric ventilation. It is derived from the Ayre T-piece used in Mapleson D circuit and function on the same principle (Garret & Stahl, 2023). The primary difference is in the length of the tubing that is increased to be greater than the patient tidal volume (Garret & Stahl, 2023). 
- There are no valves so there is no resistance to airflow. No reservoir bag or APL valve (Garret & Stahl, 2023). 
- Rebreathing is dependent on the fresh gas flow, patients minute volume and capacity of the expiratory limb (Garret & Stahl, 2023). 
- The absence of valves with the Mapleson systems can result in rebreathing of exhaled gases in a setting of decreased fresh gas flow. The use of capnometry to determine if there is rebreathing allows titration of fresh gas flow to eliminate rebreathing if desired (Kaul & Mittal, 2013).

** **
** **
**Bain Circuit **

- The Bain circuit is a modification of the Mapleson D system and is used primarily in anesthesia (Kaul & Mittal, 2013). It is especially useful in spontaneous ventilation and is widely used due to its practical features (Kaul & Mittal, 2013). (Fig 2) Shows the Bains circuit, modification of Mapleson D system. 

(Kaul & Mittal, 2013). 
 

- The Bain circuit features a coaxial design, where the fresh gas supply tube runs inside a corrugated tube (Kaul & Mittal, 2013).
- The outer tube is 22 mm in diameter, and the inner tube is 7 mm (Kaul & Mittal, 2013).
- The circuit is 1.8 meters long, and the outer tube is transparent, allowing visibility of the inner tube for checking disconnections or kinks (Kaul & Mittal, 2013). 
- The circuits length can be extended for remote use, but increasing the length raises resistance during spontaneous breathing (Kaul & Mittal, 2013). 
- Longer circuit may also reduce peak inspiratory pressures and tidal volumes, requiring ventilator adjustments (Kaul & Mittal, 2013). 

 

Advantages 

Disadvantages 

- Light weight 
- Minimal drag on ETT compared to Mapleson circuit 
- Low resistance 
- Outer tube is transparent (good for detecting disconnects or kinks) 
- Used both for spontaneous and controlled ventilation 
- Exhaled gases do not accumulate near surgical field 
- Easy for scavenging gases 

 

- Risk of disconnections due to the multiple connections involved with the circuit
- Wrong assembling of the parts can lead to malfunction of the circuit 
- Theatre pollution occurs due to high fresh gas flow 
- The inner tube can be cracked causing leakage 
- It cannot be used in pediatric patients who weight less than 20 Kg

### Response 2 (Junia Isaac):
Thank you for your detailed and well-referenced post! I appreciate how you’ve broken down the efficiency of the Mapleson circuits and provided a clear explanation of the Bain circuit's structure and usage. Your mention of specific pediatric considerations and the importance of capnometry for detecting rebreathing adds valuable depth to the discussion.
 
You noted that the Mapleson D is the most efficient for controlled ventilation, while the Mapleson A is best for spontaneous ventilation. This aligns with their design principles, as the fresh gas flow in Mapleson A minimizes rebreathing in spontaneously breathing patients (Gravenstein & Jaffe, 2021). A follow-up question: Could you expand on scenarios where Mapleson E (Ayre's T-piece) might be used for spontaneous ventilation in pediatric patients? While it's generally highlighted for controlled ventilation, are there situations where its low resistance and absence of valves might make it advantageous for spontaneously breathing infants?
 
Regarding the Bain circuit, your explanation of its coaxial design and practical advantages is excellent. I’m curious about its limitations in pediatric applications, particularly why it’s unsuitable for patients weighing less than 20 kg. Could this limitation be mitigated by adapting the design or fresh gas flow settings? This makes me think about how technological advancements might address such restrictions to expand its use.
 
Lastly, I liked how you mentioned theatre pollution as a disadvantage. It’s a crucial issue, especially in modern operating rooms emphasizing eco-conscious practices. Do you think advances in scavenging systems or gas recycling could reduce the Bain circuit’s environmental impact, or would this require a fundamental redesign of the circuit?
 
Thank you again for sharing such a thorough and engaging analysis!

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Hi Laryssa,
Thanks for the excellent overview of the Mapleson circuits.
Mapleson circuits are non-rebreathing circuits that require high fresh gas flow to remove CO2. These circuits, including the Bain circuit, are not as commonly used in operating rooms nowadays.
I want to add to Laryssa’s list of advantages and disadvantages of the Bain circuit. Because the fresh gas flow tubing runs coaxially inside the expiratory tubing, an advantage is that the exhaled gas can warm the fresh gas flow before delivering it to the patient. On the other hand, the disconnection or kinking of the inner fresh gas flow tube can sometimes be unrecognized. 
The Pethick test is a quick way to check the integrity of the Bain circuit. First, we switch to the bag mode. We occlude the patient’s end and close the APL valve. Then, we fill the circuit and inflate the reservoir bag using the oxygen flush. Once the reservoir bag is filled, release the occlusion at the patient’s end while pressing the oxygen flush. If the Bain circuit is intact with no leaks, the reservoir bag will deflate due to the Venturi effect of entraining from the reservoir bag.

# Question 9

**Question:** Question 9: What are the advantages and potential dangers of a closed anesthetic breathing circuit?

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3870/View)

### Response 1 (Mary Johnsy Joseph):
Closed breathing systems include a reservoir breathing bag, full rebreathing of exhaled gases, unidirectional valves, and a way to remove carbon dioxide. These systems, such as circle systems, function with the APL valve closed.
   The classic closed-circuit anesthesia method is different from other techniques. Once a stable level of anesthesia is achieved using high-flow oxygen, nitrous oxide, and a volatile anesthetic, the fresh gas flow is reduced to match the patient's oxygen needs, nitrous oxide absorption, and the anesthetic the patient absorbs. These rates are calculated based on the patient's weight (Philip, 2013)
   A closed anesthetic breathing circuit has several advantages and potential dangers. Here’s a breakdown:
**Advantages:**

- **Efficient Use of Anesthetic Gases:**

- The closed circuit allows for efficient use of anesthetic gases, as exhaled gases are rebreathed after carbon dioxide removal, reducing the need for fresh gas flow. This can lower overall gas consumption.

- **Maintains Consistent Anesthetic Depth:**

- Since the system recirculates the gases, it can help maintain a steady and controlled depth of anesthesia, which is beneficial for patients undergoing longer procedures.

- **Environmental and Cost Benefits:**

- By recycling anesthetic gases, a closed circuit can reduce the environmental impact and cost associated with the use of volatile anesthetics, particularly in settings where gas supply costs are a concern.

- **Reduced Heat Loss:**

- A closed circuit may help in maintaining the temperature of the gases, as the system does not rely heavily on ambient air, reducing the risk of heat loss from the patient (Butterworth, Mackey, & Wasnick, 2022; Parthasarathy, 2013)

**Potential Dangers:**

- **Hypoventilation and Hypercarbia:**

- Since the circuit is closed, there is a risk of insufficient ventilation or inadequate fresh gas flow, leading to a buildup of carbon dioxide (CO2). Without proper monitoring, this can result in hypercarbia (elevated CO2 levels), which can be dangerous.

- **Oxygen Deficiency:**

- If the oxygen flow is not managed properly, there is a risk of oxygen deficiency in a closed circuit, especially if the fresh gas flow is too low or if oxygen demand exceeds the supply.

- **Difficulty in Detecting Malfunctions:**

- In a closed circuit, problems such as leaks or circuit malfunctions may be harder to detect quickly compared to an open circuit, potentially delaying corrective action.

- **Increased Work of Breathing:**

- If the system has a high resistance or inadequate gas flow, it can lead to an increased work of breathing, which can be uncomfortable or even harmful to the patient, particularly if they are awake or lightly anesthetized.

- **Anesthetic Overdose:**

- If the system does not properly remove waste gases or adjust anesthetic concentrations, there is a risk of delivering an overdose of anesthetic agents to the patient (Butterworth, Mackey, & Wasnick, 2022; Parthasarathy, 2013)

   In practice, closed circuits are typically used in well-controlled environments where experienced anesthesiologists or anesthesia assistants can monitor and adjust the system to ensure patient safety. Regular checks and maintenance are critical to avoid the dangers associated with closed systems.

### Response 2 (Laryssa Hartmann):
Hi Mary, 
Great breakdown of the advantages and potential dangers of closed-circuit anesthesia systems. I agree that the efficiency in using anesthetic gases is a huge benefit, especially in settings where cost and environmental concerns are critical. The reduction in fresh gas flow and recycling of exhaled gases is a more sustainable approach.
You mentioned that a closed circuit can increase the risk of hypoventilation and hypercarbia. Continuous end tidal CO2 monitoring would be an excellent choice to help detect early signs of CO2 buildup and ensure patient safety. Additionally, I am curious about how these systems are evolving in terms of patient comfort. For instance, if the closed circuit is generating higher resistance, are there new practice resources or methods of ventilating that could help improve patient comfort and safety, especially in cases where the system might increase resistance or cause discomfort?

## ## Response by Phoebe Lam's Response
Thanks, Mary, for listing out the pros and cons of a closed circuit.
Another possible danger is the accumulation of undesirable gases, such as trace amounts of carbon monoxide and Compound A from the degradation of soda lime or other anesthetic agent metabolites. It is of great importance to monitor the CO2 absorbent colour change due to the danger of hypercarbia, as Mary mentioned. There is probably a need for a more frequent change of the CO2 absorbent in a closed circuit. Also, the advantage of maintaining consistent anesthetic depth can be a disadvantage because the lower the fresh gas flow rate, the longer it takes to change the concentration of the anesthetic gas mixture. 
The circle circuit can behave like a semi-open, semi-closed, and closed circuit, depending on the fresh gas flow rate. In general, our practice at University Health Network is to use it as a semi-closed circuit with low flow, trying to maximize the advantages and minimize the disadvantages. A question for everyone, what is the common practice at your institution regarding the circle circuit?
Picking up on the concerns about the environmental impact of our volatile anesthetics on the environment, Deltasorb, an anesthetic collection service, can capture unused volatile anesthetics before they are vented into the atmosphere. This is based on the use of portable stainless-steel canisters that are delivered to and exchanged weekly in participating hospitals. The canisters are installed onto the hose of the scavenging system of the anesthesia gas machine. Each canister contains a sieve-like filtering matrix that absorbs volatile anesthetics as it passes through the canister. When the canister is returned to the lab, the captured volatile anesthetics are extracted, liquified, and processed into medical-grade inhalational agents once again. For more information about waste inhalational anesthetics, check out the “Waste Anesthetic Gases Information” in the *Weeks 10 & 11 Additional Resources*. There is also a 3-minute video on the greenhouse effects of waste anesthetic gases.  This video also shows the setup of the Deltasorb canister.
