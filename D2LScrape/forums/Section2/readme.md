## Question

Question 1: What is the rationale for fluid replacement of the preoperative fasting deficit? Do clinical studies support this practice?
### Response 1 (Marjan Nematpour)

Discussion Key Questions&#160;

What is the rationale for fluid replacement of the preoperative fasting deficit? Do clinical studies support this practice?

The rationale for fluid replacement of the preoperative fasting deficit is to maintain hemodynamic stability, ensure adequate tissue perfusion, and prevent dehydration.

Both postoperative complications and patient survival are impacted by perioperative hypovolemia and fluid overload. As a result, it is crucial to administer intravenous fluids at the appropriate times and in the appropriate amounts prior to, during, and after surgery (Voldby &amp; Brandstrup, 2016).

Patients often fast before surgery to reduce the risk of aspiration, which can lead&#160;

to a fluid deficit. By replacing these fluids, clinicians aim to avoid complications like hypovolemia, hypotension, and reduced organ perfusion, which can impair recovery and increase the risk of postoperative complications. Fluid replacement also helps maintain normal electrolyte levels and reduce the metabolic stress response to surgery.

Goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT) aims to&#160; optimize preload, maintain stroke volume and cardiac index at an acceptable level ,and improve oxygen delivery (Zhu et al, 2019).

It is possible that high-risk surgical patients, such as those undergoing acute surgery, may benefit from the continuous monitoring of circulatory status that the GDFT provides (Voldby &amp; Brandstrup, 2016).

In conclusion, clinical studies on this topic have mixed results. Some studies support the practice, showing that preoperative fluid replacement improves outcomes, including faster recovery and reduced postoperative complications. However, others suggest that aggressive fluid replacement may lead to fluid overload, which is associated with complications like pulmonary edema and prolonged hospital stays. As a result, many current guidelines advocate for a balanced, individualized approach to fluid management rather than a one-size-fits-all replacement protocol. Newer recommendations often emphasize the use of goal-directed fluid therapy, where fluids are administered based on monitoring parameters rather than a standard formula for the fasting deficit.

### Response 2 (Kurt Protacio)

Hi Marjan,

&#160;

Thank you for your elegant post on this topic. Personally, I have fasted before (not for a surgery) and I recall feeling tired and hungry the whole time. One thing I would like to add is that hypoglycemia can also be experienced by those fasting prior to a procedure or surgery, specifically diabetics, neonates and children. The American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) guidelines recommend stopping clear fluid consumption 2 hours at minimum prior to surgery, and some hospitals in the U.S. are even trying to push that recommendation to 1 hour to prevent preoperative hypoglycemia (Gottlieb &amp; Andropoulos, 2023). Therefore, intravenous (IV) dextrose 5-10% is the standard choice for fluid replacement in type I diabetics preoperatively. The rate of infusion is dependent on tight glucose monitoring, and establishing a target glucose range before, during, and after surgery (Sreedharan et al., 2023; Sudhakaran &amp; Surani, 2015). In addition, IV dextrose has reduced the need for anti-emetics after general anesthesia (Kim et al., 2018).

### Response 3 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Marjan,&#160;

Thank you for your input on fluid replacement.&#160;

You mentioned it is imperative to administer IV fluids at appropriate times and appropriate amounts before, during, and after surgery. I wanted to ask you how the “appropriate amount” of IV fluids is determined for each patient?&#160;

Fluid therapy is adjusted according to the patient’s physiological needs, cardiovascular measurements, and renal function by observing urine output. However, parameters such as mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR) and urine output can also be affected by factors unrelated to volume status such as pain, temperature, and anesthetics. However, blood volume must decrease by 20% before hypovolemia is suspected and fluid overload does not manifest as changes in blood pressure or heart rate in patients who do not have heart failure. Therefore, fluid overload could potentially be unnoticed in surgical patients.&#160;

(Voldby &amp; Brandstrup, 2016).&#160;

Additionally, in what way does GDTF improve “oxygen delivery”? Can you elaborate if we are referring to a patient’s O2 saturation level or organ perfusion? Lastly, how does the goal for different fluid management differ amoung various populations (e.g. the elderly population, heart failure/fluid-restricted, dialysis patients, etc)?

### Response 4 (Ryan Smith)

Thank you Marjan, Theresa and Kurt for your excellent summaries and anecdote. Hot off the press is a concensus meta analysis (n=329 studies) with recommendations from a group in the UK published a month ago. The following are their recommendations:1

Interesting to note that 1-2 litres positive fluid balance is recommended as it showed a signal towards improved renal function outcome. Certainly this topic is of highest importance in long complex cases such as cardiac bypass, major intra-abdominal viscera resection/anastomosis etc, however it remains thematic from what I can read that conservative patient-specific evaluation remains to be of the utmost importance to all anesthesia clinicians to consider.

### Response 5 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, everyone, for your contribution to the discussion!

The practice of anesthesia is forever changing based on new evidence-based research. &#160;Fluid management is definitely a great example of this. &#160;

In the past, we calculated the preoperative fasting deficit by multiplying the maintenance fluid requirement (4-2-1 rule) by the duration of the fast. This “rule” is based on the patient’s weight with the equation: 4 mL/kg/hr for the first 10 kg + 2 mL/kg/hr for the second 10 kg + 1 mL/kg/hr for the remainder of the weight. For example, a patient who weighs 80 kg will have a 120 mL/hr maintenance fluid requirement. If this patient fasted for 8 hours, the calculated preoperative fasting deficit will be 960 mL, which needs to be replaced in addition to the maintenance requirement during surgery. Is this reasonable? How many of you will drink ~ 1L of water when you wake up in the morning? The 4-2-1 rule is only a guideline. It was developed 60 years ago to facilitate initial therapy for patients without significant co-morbidities. It is derived from its use in pediatric patients to guide children&#39;s daily needs and is not meant for intraoperative application. Furthermore, Kurt has pointed out that our fasting guidelines have changed. The Canadian Anesthesiologists’ Society Guidelines allow intake of clear fluids up to 2 hours before surgery for adults and up to 1 hour for infants and children (refer to Tenzing’s post in Question 2). Thus, this “fluid deficit” in elective surgery is really negligible. &#160;

Regarding preoperative fluid deficit, we should focus on any abnormal fluid losses such as preoperative bleeding, vomiting and diarrhea, diuresis, and increased insensible losses due to hyperventilation, fever, and sweating. Preoperative use of bowel preps is also part of this category. However, its usage has decreased significantly in current practice. Ideally, we should replace these deficits preoperatively with appropriate fluids.

What makes fluid management both challenging and interesting is that each patient demands careful consideration of their individual fluid needs. Unfortunately, applying a single, perfect formula universally to all patients is impossible, as Marjan pointed out. However, one general principle for all patient scenarios is to replace fluid lost as accurately as possible. These fluid losses can differ depending on patients’ medical conditions, volume, and composition, as Kurt alluded to. For example, a patient admitted to the hospital with severe burns will have much more significant fluid losses than a relatively healthy patient who is allowed nothing by mouth and awaiting a procedure. A patient admitted for dehydration from severe diarrhea might require different fluid compositions than a patient admitted in hypovolemic shock from a brisk upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleed.

### Response 2 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, Greg, for starting the discussion on IV insertion in adults.

I totally agree with Greg that applying a warm compress is key, especially in patients with bad veins (like myself). A quick tip: if a warm blanket is not readily available, I will make my own warm water bag by filling a glove with warm tap water &#128522;.&#160;

I also want to touch upon the considerations in choosing the insertion site. Obviously, I’ll avoid sclerosed or varicose veins and pick the straighter and “juicier” ones. I always start at the most distal veins, such as metacarpal (my go-to), cephalic (my backup), and basilica veins, because this will allow further attempts above the selected vein and thus, reducing the risk of infiltrating IV fluid/drugs into the surrounding tissues of any previous puncture sites. &#160;Adding to Greg&#39;s point of using traction to secure rolling veins, I like to pick a metacarpal vein that has a bifurcation because the bifurcation can act as a natural anchor and reduce the required traction. I would attempt the insertion proximal to, not directly at, the bifurcation because there is almost always a valve at the junction. If I come across a valve, I usually try to use a saline flush to float the IV catheter beyond the valve. In an emergency situation, I always insert it in the antecubital vein. This is also why I avoid using this site during routine IV insertions.&#160;

Greg also brought up local freezing. I always use freezing for 18g and bigger needles, sometimes for 20g, and usually not for 22g. My rationale is to avoid poking my patient twice as we use a 25g freezing needle, which is about the same size as the actual 22g IV. However, some of my colleagues will always use freezing for all of their IVs. I wonder what others do in their practice. Would you use local freezing for all IVs?

### Response 3 (Janet Rozek)

Great review Greg,&#160;

I use very similar techniques to my IV insertion tips!

I often use warm water in a glove as my go to, to engorge veins when someone is anxious, cold or really dehydrated.&#160;

Sometimes I use the double tourniquet technique if the patient has had failed attempts, or has a higher BMI with poor visibility for access.&#160;

In my facility most anesthesiologists will use local freezing for IV starts that are higher gauges as Professor Lam had addressed in her own practice.

### Response 4 (Adrian Harris)

Hi Greg, Janet and Phoebe! I want to thank you for offering some fantastic info on intravenous (IV) starts.&#160; Personally, I’m looking forward to improving my skill level with IVs. Using this info you’ve provided along with all these great tips on the insertion process is really going to help.

As Greg mentioned, a vein finder can also assist with locating suitable veins.&#160; At my institution there is a vein finder in use in the regional anesthesia area, so I thought I’d dig a little deeper and share how it can help with IV starts.

&#160;

The VeinViewer is one of several devices on the market that provides its’ user with an image of the blood vessels that sit from about 5-15 millimetres under the skin, depending on the model (1).&#160;

&#160;

As shown in Figure 1 below, these vein-finding devices use a processed image of near-infrared light that sits on a patient’s skin.&#160; This light is normally absorbed in the hemoglobin-filled vessels but in the other tissues is reflected away (1). &#160;The VeinViewer will take the processed image of the vessels, it will add some colour and contrast and then display an image on the skin in real-time above the vessels (1). This allows the user to visualize veins, valves and bifurcations, and often can differentiate between healthy and sclerotic veins (1).

&#160;

The VeinViewer can be adjusted to provide a universal, or more general patient-type viewing mode, as well as modes for fine and inverse detail for pediatric or darker-skinned patients, respectively (1). &#160;

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

In one recent study, medical student trainees using a near-infrared viewer for difficult adult venous access achieved venous access quicker and with less training, when compared to ultrasound-guided access (3).&#160; However, one drawback of the VeinViewer is its’ inability to display deeper vessels (greater than 5-15mm deep), which may limit the users’ choices for access (3).&#160; Either way, near-infrared light devices such as VeinViewer can be an additional useful tool in the anesthesia provider’s toolkit to improve the chances of a successful and efficient IV start.&#160;

### Response 5 (Tenzing Choedar)

Hi Gregori and everyone that has contributed to this discussion,

Thank you for the insightful review on IV insertion techniques. I fully agree with Phoebe’s approach to site selection, starting distally with metacarpal veins before progressing proximally to the antecubital region. As a Registered Nurse in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit (CICU) who oversees code blue responses at Toronto General Hospital and assists in the Cath lab at St. Michael’s hospital, IV insertion is an integral part of my daily practice. Through my five years of experience, I’ve developed a nuanced approach to site selection, often tailored to the patient’s specific clinical condition. In most cases, I prefer to begin with the dorsal metacarpal veins, which are typically easy to locate and engorge with the application of a tourniquet, before moving to more proximal sites, with the cephalic and basilic veins being among my preferred choices.

A key insight I’ve gained is the importance of memorizing the venous anatomy of the arm. This familiarity enables me to locate difficult-to-visualize veins through palpation, particularly in patients with obesity or those in states of shock. Due to this skill, I rarely need to rely on ultrasound. In addition to already mentioned techniques in the above posts, such as applying warm blankets, utilizing a double tourniquet, keeping skin taut, flushing of the catheter to advance it pass the valve, I have a few additional methods that have proven useful in practice, which I am happy to share.

-**Let gravity be your friend**. I often elevate the bed after applying the tourniquet, allowing the arm to hang freely downward. For alert and conscious patients, I instruct them to repeatedly clench and release their fist, as if exercising. This action promotes arterial flow and, ultimately, enhances venous return engorging the vein. If the patient is intubated, this next step might prove useful as it does not require patient’s cooperation.

-**Applying gentle taps to the preferred site**. I learned that applying gentle finger taps to the selected site promotes venodilation. This is due to the sheer stress applied on the endothelial walls of the veins promotes the release of nitric oxide (NO) along with other venodilator substances (Lu &amp; Kassab, 2011). A small study by Ichimura et al. (2020) investigated whether tapping could promote vasodilation in individuals with veins that are challenging to palpate. They found that tapping the skin over a vein expanded the vein&#39;s width and brought it closer to the skin surface by 5-6% compared to the control group making it easier to access.

Cross-sectional area increased (14.6 &#177; 9.12 mm2 for control and 15.2 &#177; 9.79 mm2 for tapping)
Venous depth significantly decreased (4.57 &#177; 2.31 mm for control and 4.23 &#177; 2.41 mm for tapping).

&#160;

-The last trick I have only done it once when my ICU fellow was quite busy in the unit to put in a central line in my patient who was in mix cardiogenic and hypovolemic (dominant) shock albeit stable and I needed more peripheral access to provide additional medications. Patient was peripherally cool and venous capacitance was low. I learned this trick from one of the anesthesiologists that I consider my mentor at St. Michael’s hospital.

Patient already had a working peripheral IV in the metacarpal vein. What I subsequently did was apply a tourniquet in the upper brachial region of the same arm while an ordered bolus of 250ml of LR was started to go over 10 minutes. With the bolus going distally from the metacarpal IV and the tourniquet on the proximal side, this allowed the vein to be filled and engorged proximally allowing me to palpate and quickly put in an 18 gauge in the AC. This was all done within three minutes. Key is to make sure at least 60-70cc is infused within two to three minutes. I have not found any literature review regarding this technique.

&#160;

Adrian, thank you for the excellent information about the VeinViewer vein finder. I hope more institutions adopt this practice or at least make it readily available in ICUs, ERs, and ORs. It would undoubtedly save us time and reduce unnecessary pokes and pain for patients.

### Response 6 (Gregori Kuran)

Hi Phoebe,

Thank you adding the valuable information to my post and for the question as well. In terms my personal practice and experience at SickKids we almost never use local freezing prior to placing PIV&#39;s. The main reason for this is that typically if we are starting an IV on an older/cooperative paediatric patient prior to induction we typically only put in a 24g or 22g that we use for induction. For paediatric patients having to give them a second poke with a 25g to give local freezing prior to placing such a small PIV would make the experience more traumatic for them as they would view it as an &quot;extra poke&quot;. If they require a larger bore PIV we typically do that once we have secured an airway and the patient is fully anesthetized. I work in interventional radiology currently and when we place PICC&#39;s we typically access the vein with a 22g or 24g and in those cases we do give local anesthesia but those tend be more invasive as it requires a small incision to be made near the access as well as some minor dissection if we are using a cuffed line (this is typical for younger paediatric patient at SickKids). On another side note I recently got trained on ultrasound guided IV&#39;s and I have found this has been a great tool to use when needing to get a larger bore PIV on a paediatric patient with difficult/small veins.

### Response 7 (Shawn Page)

Adrian, thanks for the reminder about vein finding tools! I don&#39;t know why but I always forget about these.&#160; But the few times I&#39;ve seen them used in the ER or ICU its totally awesome.

I have heard of the warming with a blanket trick, but never the warm water in a glove one.

My organization has a policy that any PIV that is 18g or larger we must use injectable lido at the site.

Does anyone have a comment on the - tapping the site - to irritate the vessel? I see it a lot, but not sure what its for, and if it actually works.

### Response 8 (Tenzing Choedar)

I tap all the time. I wrote about it in my post. It works very well.&#160;

### Response 1 (Deena Kurilsky)

**Equipment and supplies needed for the procedure:**

Personal protective equipment (PPE): including nonsterile and sterile gloves, mask, sterile gown, hair cover and protective eyewear
Lidocaine 1-2% in 5cc syringe with a 24–25-gauge needle
Catheter securement device – Tegaderm + clear tape

Medications that could increase bleeding risk (heparin or fibrinolytic)
Recent lab results: platelets, elevated PTT or INR
Allergies
History of coagulopathy, vascular grafts and thromboangitis obliterans (Wallace &amp; Solano, 2023)

Establish ECG, SpO2 and NIBP
Prepare pressure transducer set up. Flush with normal saline, tighten connections, ensure there are no air bubbles in the tubing and all vented caps have been switched to sterile stopcock caps. Inflate pressure bag appropriately.
Confirm collateral circulation if performing a radial arterial line by completing a modified allen’s test, alternatively use Doppler ultrasound to assess for ulnar blood flow The test ensures sufficient collateral ulnar arterial blood flow to avoid distal ischemic injury (Wallace &amp; Solano, 2023; Caple et al, 2024).

****

**Procedure:**

Introduce yourself, confirm patient identity using 2 identifiers (full name and date of birth) followed by explanation of the procedure and informed consent
Perform hand hygiene and assist patient into supine position
If cannulating radial artery

Have the patient extend their forearm and slightly extend their wrist with ventral side facing up. Placing a rolled towel under the patient’s wrist will help to improve access to the artery. Tape the hand in this position (Wallace &amp; Solano, 2023)

If cannulating brachial artery

Use a pillow or towels to elevate and hyperextend the elbow of the chosen arm with the ventral side of the arm facing up

Other insertion sites in the lower extremities:

Femoral
Dorsalis pedis
Posterior tibial artery (Pierre et al, 2024)

Confirm pressure transducer is attached to pressure cable and monitor, has no air bubbles and is easily accessible to connect&#160;&#160;
To prepare the equipment use a surgical aseptic non touch technique. This includes minimizing staff activity in the area by drawing the current, disinfect the working surface or table with chlorohexidine wipes, the use of an aseptic field (sterile drape), opening sterile supplies onto the aseptic field that will be utilized throughout the procedure
Equipment that will be placed in the aseptic field

Sterile gauze
Angiocath + guidewire
Tegaderm securing device
Lidocaine drawn up in a 5cc syringe with a 22-24 gauge needle

Performing the catheter insertion, in a sterile technique:

Prepare the insertion site and surrounding area thoroughly with a chlorhexidine swab, allow it to dry fully before placing the sterile drape on top of it
Put on sterile PPE and drape the insertion site
Administer 1-2ml of local anesthesia to the insertion site, aspirating before injecting to ensure you are not in a vessel
Insertion techniques:

Catheter-over-needle

Puncture the artery at a 30–45-degree angle until you see flash, advance the needle slightly further so the catheter is in the middle of the artery
Drop the angle to 10 degrees and thread the catheter over the needle in a twisting motion
Retract the needle, you should see pulsatile bright-red blood from the hub of the catheter
If you do not see pulsatile flow, you are not in the artery – see seldinger technique

Catheter-over-wire&#160;– allows the clinician to gain access to the arterial lumen with the help of a guidewire

Seldinger technique
Puncture the artery at a 30–45-degree angle until you see flash, advance the needle slightly further so the catheter is in the middle of the artery, drop the angle to 10 degrees
Remove the needle or slowly pull back on the catheter (if you couldn’t thread the catheter over the needle) until you see pulsatile blood flow, insert the guidewire, no resistance should be met while you advance the catheter over the wire into the artery
Modified Seldinger

Same as seldinger technique with the use of an integrated needle-catheter-wire system. No separate guidewire is used
Advancing catheter over the integrated guidewire into the vessel once pulsatile blood flow is achieved&#160;(Pierre et al.,2024).

&#160;

Remove the wire and connect arterial catheter hub to the pressure tubing (Wallace &amp; Solano, 2023;&#160;Pierre et al, 2024).
An arterial line waveform should appear on the monitor to confirm your placement

Apply sterile dressing and clear tape to secure tubing, padding any pressure points with gauze
Ensure the transducer is at the correct level of the heart (phlebostatic axis)

If the transducer is too high the result will be a falsely low blood pressure, alternatively if it is too low the blood pressure will be falsely elevated (Caple et al, 2024).

Zero the transducer and verify arterial waveform, optimize waveform if necessary

To zero the transducer, turn the stopcock off to patient and remove nonvented cap. The line is now open to air, press the zero button on the monitor, turn transducer open to patient and off to open air and replace sterile cap. The arterial waveform should return (Baggs, 2024).

Verify alarms are set appropriately
Discard PPE and perform hand hygiene.
Use of an ultrasound machine is recommended if clinician is trained. Use of the linear probe identifies the vessel and improves first attempt accuracy. It is associated with a high success rate, shorter procedure time and less hematoma formation (Pierre et al., 2024).

### Response 2 (Reneerose Ong)

Thanks for the comprehensive breakdown of arterial line insertion equipment and the procedure! Your post is very detailed and clearly organized, making it easy to follow each step.

I found it particularly helpful that you highlighted the use of modified Seldinger techniques and different catheter specifications for adult and pediatric patients. The emphasis on maintaining an aseptic field and performing a modified Allen&#39;s test to confirm collateral circulation is crucial.

I noticed you mentioned using Doppler ultrasound to assess ulnar blood flow, which is a fantastic point. The use of ultrasound can be a game-changer, especially in cases where vascular access is challenging, or the anatomy is not straightforward. At my institution, we also find that using ultrasound significantly improves our first-attempt success rates.

One question I have is whether you&#39;ve had experience using ultrasound guidance in more difficult cases or if there are any specific challenges you’ve encountered with different arterial sites, such as the femoral artery. I&#39;d love to hear about any tips you have for troubleshooting when arterial access proves difficult, especially in patients with poor vascular access.

### Response 3 (Deena Kurilsky)

Hi Reneerose! Thank you for your response. While I don’t have personal experience with inserting femoral arterial lines, I gathered some information to share.

When using an ultrasound to identify the target vessel the arteries are best visualized in the transverse plane, they appear as round structures with thick walls opposed to veins which are ovoid. Typically arteries show pulsations and cannot be compressed, the use of color flow doppler can help confirm the presence pulsatile flow. In the case of the patient with a very superficial vessel it is important to be cautious of the weight of the probe, more peripheral arteries may occlude more easily.

Femoral arteries are often the second most used site for arterial cannulation valued for its ease of access and low complication rates. The brachial artery lacks collateral circulation and as a result has increased risk for ischemic complications. The femoral artery more closely resembles the aortic pressure waveforms than those from any other peripheral site. Cannulation becomes increasingly difficult the farther the puncture site is from the inguinal ligament, as the artery branches into the superficial and deep femoral arteries. The deep femoral artery can be particularly challenging to compress if bleeding occurs. It’s important to landmark and avoid the femoral nerve and vein, located on the lateral and medial sites (see diagram). Only the Seldinger technique is recommended for this site. It is also recommended to use an angle of entry at 45 degrees compared to the arterial site at 10-20 degrees.

The abundant soft tissue around the femoral artery can make it difficult to control bleeding and large hematomas are not uncommon. A rare incidence is a retroperitoneal hematoma, this may be associated with patients that develop hypovolemic shock with a declining hematocrit post femoral artery insertion. Pseudoaneurysms may occur as well as hematomas can be painful and slow to heal, often resulting from multiple punctures or inadequate pressure application.

It is best practice regardless of the insertion site to minimize puncture attempts and apply adequate pressure after the procedure to reduce complications.

### Response 4 (Meera Sathananthan)

Deena, thank you for such a detailed breakdown of arterial line set up and insertion!&#160;I&#39;d love to add a few tips and tricks to help optimize arterial line insertion:

Position, position, position

Proper setup and positioning are crucial—it&#39;s where I spend the most time during arterial line insertions. Positioning the patient with the wrist extended and securely taped in place, adjusting the bed height, and assessing whether the pulse improves with different wrist angles all help to optimize both the pulse and setup. This way, I’m not straining or forced into awkward positions during insertion, and the artery is optimized for cannulation.

For femoral artery insertions, a helpful tip is to externally rotate the patient’s hip into a “frog-leg” position, which minimizes the overlap between the femoral artery and vein (1). Using ultrasound here is invaluable, providing direct visualization of the needle’s trajectory and helping avoid nearby structures, as shown in Deena’s post.

Keep everything close

Having everything within arm’s reach is essential to maintain sterility and efficiency. Some angiocatheters, like those in the Arrow Seldinger kit, have long components, so it’s helpful to grab a nearby table to keep items secure and sterile.

Use of Ultrasound

More practitioners are now using ultrasound as a first-line tool for arterial line insertion, rather than a last-ditch effort. RTs are now able to insert arterial lines under ultrasound guidance at the institution I work at, and it has been super helpful! Although the sterile setup can take a bit of time, having that visual confirmation is so reassuring—especially for patients with thready or faint pulses. It reduces the risk of complications and increases the chances of success.

I found this helpful image demonstrating the steps of ultrasound-guided insertion (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Short axis view (SAX out-of-plane approach) for ultrasound-guided arterial catheter insertion. A) the needle punctures the skin and approaches the vessel. B) the needle begins entering the vessel. C) the needle is centered in the vessel, confirming the tip&#39;s placement in the vessel. Here, the needle&#39;s angle can be decreased, bringing the needle closer to the skin. D) and E) the needle and catheter are &quot;walked forward&quot; with ultrasound guidance—the probe is moved away from the needle tip, then the tip is brought back into the ultrasound view. At this point, the catheter can be advanced over the needle and into the vessel (1).

### Response 5 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Fantastic discussion on arterial line insertion! Thanks, everyone, for sharing your practice and insights.

The only thing I want to add is to ensure an intravenous is in place before attempting any arterial line insertion, especially for awake patients. I have had a couple of patients experience vasovagal responses during and right after arterial line insertion. You can almost tell one is coming as soon as you see the eyes rolling backward. Luckily, other anesthesia assistants and preoperative nurses are always around to help bolus the patient with IV fluids and take vitals. A wet towel on the head can also provide some comfort.&#160;

Regarding vasovagal responses, don’t limit that to just the patients. I have had a patient’s family member experience a vasovagal reaction while I was inserting the arterial line. Usually, a cup of juice will do the trick in this case. I typically allow a family member to be with the patient for support and comfort. However, I always ask if they are afraid of seeing blood. If so, I kindly escort them to the waiting area.&#160;

# Question 12

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3285/View)

## Question

Question 12: Compare and contrast between different IV fluids (e.g., Normal Saline, Dextrose, Ringer’s Lactate, Plasma-Lyte).
### Response 1 (Laryssa Hartmann)

Crystalloids:&#160;&#160;

fluid solutions that are a mixture of water and&#160;electrolytes. They can be classified by their tonicity, which compares their osmotic pressure to that of plasma. They can either be hypotonic, isotonic or hypertonic. They can also be categorized as balanced (physiologic) crystalloid solutions, that have a composition similar to extracellular fluid but are usually slightly hypotonic due to lower sodium levels. Administering large volumes of these balanced solutions can lead to issues like hyperlactatemia, metabolic alkalosis and hypotonicity (Wang &amp; Spellman, 2022).&#160;

Crystalloid solutions do not contribute to oncotic pressure because they diffuse out of the intravascular space shortly after administration (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023).&#160;&#160;

To maintain equal intracellular and extracellular compartment osmolarity, hypotonic fluids will shift water toward the intracellular compartment, whereas hypertonic fluids will shift water toward the extracellular compartment (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023).&#160;

Examples of crystalloids: normal saline, lactated ringers’ solution, dextrose solutions, and plasma-Lyte (Plasma-Lyte 148)&#160;

Crystalloids can be isotonic, hypertonic or hypotonic relative to the plasma (Tinawi, 2021).&#160;&#160;&#160;

The half-life of crystalloid intravenous solution is 20-40minutes. In the presence of dehydration or preoperative stress, half life may become longer (Tinawi, 2021).&#160;&#160;&#160;

The best type of IV fluids for fluid resuscitation is often debated. Recent studies compare normal saline (NS) to balanced crystalloid solutions regarding their impact on kidney function and mortality (Wang &amp; Spellman, 2022).&#160;&#160;

In a trial with 2,278 ICU patients in New Zealand, research found no significant differences in acute kidney injury, the need for renal replacement therapy (RRT), or in-hospital mortality between those receiving normal saline and those receiving a balanced solution (such as Plasma-Lyte 148) (Wang &amp; Spellman, 2022).&#160;&#160;

However, a larger study involving 15,802 critically ill adults showed that patients receiving balanced crystalloids (like lactated Ringer or Plasma-Lyte A) had a lower incidence of major kidney events, including death or the need for RRT, compared to those receiving saline (Wang &amp; Spellman, 2022).&#160;&#160;

Another study included 13,347 noncritically ill patients in the emergency department, also comparing balanced crystalloids with saline, focusing on hospital-free days and major kidney events. There was no difference between saline and balanced crystalloids in hospital free days however, patients receiving balanced crystalloids had a lower incidence of death requirement of new onset RRT and persistent renal dysfunction (Wang &amp; Spellman, 2022).&#160;&#160;

The evidence suggests that balanced crystalloids (such as Plasma-Lyte and Lactated ringers) may be more beneficial for renal outcomes compared to normal saline, particularly in critically ill population, although results vary based on patient context and study design (Wang &amp; Spellman, 2022).&#160;&#160;

&#160;

Normal Saline (0.9% Sodium Chloride)&#160;

Dextrose Solutions (D5W)&#160;

Ringers Lactate (Lactated Ringers)&#160;

Plasma-Lyte (Plasma-Lyte A, Plasma-Lyte 148)&#160;&#160;

Composition&#160;&#160;

Normal saline is the most used unbalanced crystalloid, with an isotonic concentration of sodium chloride and an osmolarity like plasma, containing 15.4 mEq of sodium and chloride ions. Its PH is 5.60.&#160;

(Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019; Tinawi, 2021). It is a slightly hypertonic solution with supraphysiologic concentrations of sodium and chloride (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023). &#160;

&#160;

5% dextrose injection is the most commonly used isotonic dextrose and water solution, with an osmolarity of 278 mOsm/L and providing 170Kcal/L(Tinawi, 2021). It is metabolized into water and CO2 (Tinawi, 2021). Dextrose is also available in combination with electrolytes and potassium chloride (Vallerand, 2019).&#160;

&#160;

Isotonic.&#160;&#160;

Further classified as a balanced or buffered solution used for fluid replacement (Singh et al., 2023).&#160;

The contents of Ringer&#39;s lactate include sodium, chloride, potassium, calcium, and lactate in the form of sodium lactate, mixed into a solution with an osmolarity of 273 mOsm/L and pH of about 6.5 (Singh et al., 2023). &#160;

Isotonic.&#160;&#160;

Physiochemical composition that closely reflects human plasma (Weinberg et al., 2016). Can be classified as a balanced crystalloid (Weinberg et al., 2016).&#160;&#160;

Contains sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium acetate and sodium gluconate (Weinberg et al., 2016). The PH is 7.4 (Tinawi, 2021). &#160;

Plasma-Lyte 148 is calcium free and therefore compatible with blood and blood components. &#160;

osmolality of 271 mOsmol/kg (Weinberg et al., 2016).&#160;

&#160;

Pros&#160;

Easily available and isotonic, making it a safe solution for most patients. Good for diluting medication.&#160;&#160;

Offer a source of energy and provides calories. Often used in the OR for when patients are fasting&#160;

Lactate is a beneficial molecule, given its metabolism, effective for acidosis (Maheshwari et al., 2020). Its cost effective and safe. Can be used during and after surgery, particularly trauma or major surgeries (Maheshwari et al., 2020).&#160;

Offers balanced electrolyte composition with fewer side effects. It is used as a balanced fluid option during surgeries. Good for patients who may have complex fluid or electrolyte needs. Compared to Ringers, PlasmaLyte does not rely solely on liver function making it more effective during severe shock (Weinberg et al., 2016). Plasma-Lyte 148 contains acetate as its organic anion and is quickly metabolized generating bicarbonate to help treat acidosis (Weinberg et al., 2016). Studies have shown that sodium acetate can correct metabolic acidosis, particularly in premature infants (Weinberg et al., 2016). In a trial with critically ill trauma patients, resuscitation with acetate led to stable hemodynamics and rapid correction of acidosis without complications (Weinberg et al., 2016).&#160;&#160;

Cons&#160;

Large volumes of normal saline can lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023). It may also increase plasma potassium levels due to cellular shifts, with levels potentially matching or exceeding baseline compared to balanced solutions (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023). Iatrogenic fluid overload is a concern, especially in patients with impaired kidney function or congestive heart failure, as it can cause life-threatening pulmonary edema and worsen heart failure (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019).&#160;

5% dextrose should not be used alone for fluid resuscitation in cases of hypovolemia, hypotension, shock or metabolic alkalosis and should be avoided in patients with hyponatremia. Large volumes can cause fluid overload (Tinawi, 2021). Blood and urine glucose levels should be monitored, and insulin may be necessary (Vallerand, 2019). Concentrated dextrose solutions (10-70%) contain aluminum, which can become toxic with prolonged use, especially in patients with impaired kidney function or premature neonates, leading to CNS and bone toxicity (Vallerand, 2019).&#160;&#160;

&#160;

Lactate is primarily metabolized in the liver, so hepatic dysfunction can lead to lactate accumulation (Singh et al., 2023). Patients with cerebral edema requiring osmotic therapy should avoid hypotonic or isotonic fluids, as these may cause swelling and edema, particularly in those with congestive heart failure or chronic kidney disease. Additionally, Ringer’s lactate contains calcium, making it unsuitable as a diluent for blood transfusions (Singh et al., 2023).&#160; Toxicity related to intravenous fluid administration is primarily associated with volume overload rather than the specific contents of the fluids. For symptomatic patients, diuretics should be administered to manage this overload (Maheshwari et al., 2020).

Potential issues with Ringer’s lactate: &#160;

Electrolyte imbalances: can affect electrolyte levels, monitoring is important especially in patients with certain conditions (renal issues, hyperkalemia, or hypercalcaemia) (Uribe, 2024).&#160;&#160;

Lactate levels: lactate is usually metabolized in the body. Patients with renal failure may accumulate lactate (Uribe,2024).&#160;&#160;

Overall, careful monitoring and management of IV fluid administration are essential to prevent these adverse effects.&#160;&#160;

&#160;

Should be used cautiously in patients receiving ACE inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor antagonists, calcineurin inhibitors due to increase the risk of hyperkalemia (Weinberg et al., 2016). Plasma-Lyte is an alkalinizing solution, it may increase plasma PH and should be administered cautiously to patients with alkalosis (Weinberg et al., 2016). Like other IV fluids can cause overload and should be monitored carefully for symptoms.&#160;&#160;

Uses&#160;

Extra cellular fluid replacement (ex. Dehydration, hypovolemia, hemorrhage, sepsis) (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019). Treatment of metabolic alkalosis (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019).&#160; Also used as pharmaceutical aids and diluents for the infusion of compatible drug additives (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019).&#160;&#160;

Used to correct hypernatremia, hypoglycemia. Used for parenteral nutrition and hydration. Used as a source of calories and water (Tinawi, 2021).&#160; Other dextrose in water solutions such as 10% and 50% are used in the management of severe hypoglycemia (Tinawi, 2021).&#160;&#160;&#160;

&#160;

Ringer&#39;s lactate is a great fluid for aggressive fluid replacement in many clinical situations, including sepsis and acute pancreatitis (Singh et al., 2023). &#160;&#160;

Volume resuscitation: intravascular volume expands, increasing preload and thus perfusion (Singh et al., 2023).&#160;&#160;

Provides the body with sodium lactate: sodium lactate is a bioenergetic fuel that the human body is designed to metabolize under ischemic conditions and thus decreasing cellular death from ischemia (Singh et al., 2023).&#160;&#160;

Plasma-Lyte is indicated for use in situations where fluid and electrolyte management is critical, particularly in surgical and critically ill patients (Weinberg et al., 2016).&#160;

Plasma-Lyte148 may have a beneficial role in patients who present in diabetic ketoacidosis (Weinberg et al., 2016). Use of Plasma-Lyte 148 prevented the development of a hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis in diabetic patients (Weinberg et al., 2016).&#160;&#160;&#160;

Administration&#160;

Can be administered only via IV:&#160;

Fluid bolus: normally used in the acute care setting when a rapid infusion is necessary (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019).&#160;&#160;

Maintenance: the calculation of daily fluid requirements must be used before considering using normal saline as maintenance (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019).&#160;&#160;&#160;

Can be PO or IV :&#160;

PO: concentrated dextrose gels and chewable tables may be used in the treatment of hypoglycemia in conscious patients. May be followed by more complex carbohydrates (Dextrose, 2024).&#160;&#160; &#160;

IV: administer hypertonic dextrose solution (&gt;5% ) IV into a central vein. For emergency treatment of hypoglycemia (Dextrose, 2024). &#160;

Electrolytes can be added to dextrose solutions for patients requiring prolonged infusions. This prevents water intoxication and maintain electrolyte balance (Dextrose, 2024).&#160;&#160;

Most administered via intravenous route but may also be safely administered intraosseous route (Singh et al., 2023). The goal of administering is to replenish the intravascular volume to permit adequate organ perfusion (Singh et al., 2023).&#160;&#160;

&#160;

Intravenously administered (Weinberg et al., 2016).&#160;&#160;&#160;

### Response 2 (Deena Kurilsky)

Thank you Laryssa! Excellent summary! Your comprehensive overview of crystalloid solutions, their classifications, compositions, pros and cons, and their clinical applications really clarifies the complexities of fluid resuscitation.&#160;

&#160;

I was interested in your point stating that balanced crystalloids (such as Plasma-Lyte and Lactated ringers) may be more beneficial for renal outcomes compared to normal saline.&#160;

&#160;

Like you summarized, balanced crystalloids have an electrolyte composition that closely resembles that of extracellular fluid, containing lower concentrations of sodium and chloride. Normal saline has a high chloride concentration, and administration in large volumes can lead to hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis. Why is this bad? It can negatively impact renal function.&#160;

&#160;

The presence of buffers (like lactate or acetate) in balanced crystalloids helps mitigate metabolic acidosis. Acidosis can lead to renal vasoconstriction and impaired glomerular filtration. The hyperchloremic effects can contribute to fluid overload increasing the risk of pulmonary edema and placing additional stress on the kidneys.

### Response 3 (Dan Chen)

Excellent summary on the topic of crystalloids, Laryssa!

You’ve provided a thorough overview of the various crystalloid solutions and their applications. One important point to consider, particularly in the OR, is the role of these fluids in maintaining hemostasis during surgical procedures.&#160;For instance, while balanced crystalloids like Ringer&#39;s Lactate and Plasma-Lyte are excellent for maintaining electrolyte balance and preventing metabolic acidosis, they can also help minimize the risk of coagulopathy associated with large volumes of normal saline. The hyperchloremic effect of normal saline can impair platelet function and lead to increased bleeding risk during surgery (Hanke et al., 2011).

In contrast, balanced solutions tend to preserve hemostatic function better, which is crucial when managing patients who may have significant blood loss. This aspect underscores the importance of fluid choice not only for resuscitation but also for optimizing surgical outcomes. It would be beneficial to incorporate this perspective into our discussions on fluid management in the OR (Guidet et al., 2010).

### Response 4 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Laryssa,

You’ve highlighted an excellent summary of the different IV fluids. I also wanted to add half normal saline to your list (0.45% sodium chloride). It is a hypotonic concentration of sodium chloride that is best administered for parenteral maintenance fluids instead of aggressive intravascular volume repletion (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019). Additionally, if 0.45% NaCl is overused, it could cause hyponatremia and cerebral edema due to its hypotonic concentration - water molecules would travel into areas of higher sodium concentration (Tonog &amp; Lakhkar, 2019).

In your table, you have stated that D5W can be a source of energy and calories when used in the OR for when patients are fasting. My question is, does this apply for all patients or only to a specific population, such as patients who are diabetic?&#160;

You have also stated that more concentrated dextrose solutions (10-70%) can become toxic with prolonged usage especially in certain populations (e.g. patients with impaired kidney function or premature neonates). My next question is what interventions can be done to mitigate such risks?

### Response 5 (Laryssa Hartmann)

Thank you for your thoughtful responses, everyone!

Teresa thank you for adding half normal saline to the discussion! I appreciate the insights on its use and the potential risks of hyponatremia and cerebral edema. These are important points to consider.

&#160;

Regarding your question about D5W, while it can provide calories, it is generally more beneficial for patients who are fasting in a nondiabetic state. Diabetic patients, on the other hand, may need to be cautious due to their unique metabolic needs and potential for glycemic fluctuations (Vallerand, 2019). For diabetic patients it is especially important to ensure frequent lab assessments to monitor the appropriate doses (Vallerand, 2019). However, it is essential to assess each patients’ individual circumstances before deciding on fluid management.

&#160;

As for the use of concentrated dextrose solutions, to mitigate the risks of toxicity, careful monitoring is crucial. Interventions may include using lower concentrations when possible, giving the solution slowly, and regularly checking blood glucose levels (Dextrose 50% Injection, 2022). When concentrated dextrose infusion is abruptly withdrawn, it is also advised to follow with a dextrose injection of 5-10% to avoid rebound hypoglycemia (Dextrose 50% Injection, 2022). Adding electrolytes to dextrose solution for patients requiring prolonged infusions of dextrose, is also recommended to prevent water intoxication and maintain appropriate electrolyte balance (Vallerand, 2019). In high-risk populations like those with impaired kidney function or premature neonates, collaborating closely with a multidisciplinary team can help tailor the approach to each patients needs.

&#160;

One interesting study I found regarding concentrated dextrose solutions is about how paramedics often administer a 25 g dose of 50% dextrose (D50) to severely hypoglycemic patients to help restore consciousness (Hurtubise et al., 2021). However, this high dose can lead to complications in regulating blood glucose levels afterward (Hurtubise et al., 2021). The study explored whether a lower concentration of 10% dextrose (D10) might effectively alleviate symptoms with less risk.

&#160;

The key finding indicated that the D50 group had a higher increase in post-treatment blood sugar levels (3.2 mmol/L) compared to the D10 group (Hurtubise et al., 2021). However, symptoms resolution was better in the D10 group, although D10 treatment took about 4 minutes longer to resolves symptoms. Both treatments effectively resolved hypoglycemia, but there were no adverse events reported in the D10 group, while the D50 group experienced 13 adverse events (Hurtubise et al., 2021). This highlights how D10 may be as effective as D50 for treating hypoglycemia, with fewer adverse events and a lower risk of causing high blood sugar afterward, despite taking slightly longer to achieve symptom relief. It is advisable to consider using lower concentrations of dextrose, when possible, to minimize adverse events and ensure patient safety, being mindful of the specific circumstances.

Thank you again for your contributions to the discussion!

### Response 6 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, Laryssa, for such an easy-to-read chart that is great for easy reference. &#160;

With so many different fluid choices, we must consider the patient’s underlying electrolyte status when selecting the appropriate fluid replacement. &#160;

The fluids most often used are normal saline, Ringer’s Lactate, and Plasma-Lyte in the operating room. We usually start with normal saline. Not to mention that it is the cheapest, normal saline contains no buffer or other electrolytes, which makes it great for priming hemodynamic lines, diluting drugs and packed red blood cells (PRBCs), and surgical irrigation. Compared to Ringer’s Lactate and Plasma-Lyte, normal saline is the only one that has no potassium, and thus, it is suitable for patients who are sensitive to potassium. However, normal saline is not that “normal,” as too much normal saline can cause metabolic acidosis, as mentioned above. In addition to the caution of potassium, Ringer’s Lactate is the only one that contains calcium, and we should avoid mixing it with PRBCs to prevent possible clotting, as described by Laryssa.&#160;Plasma-Lyte is the best at mimicking plasma in its electrolytes, osmolality, and pH content. However, it is the only one that contains magnesium, which may affect peripheral vascular resistance and slow heart rate.

We often use Plasma-Lyte in Toronto General Hospital (TGH) operating rooms. However, I was surprised that Plasma-Lyte is not readily available everywhere within TGH. I have been providing mock code simulations to nurses on the cardiac floors, and I learned they do not have Plasma-Lyte. Apparently, it is mainly available in perioperative areas and ICUs. I am guessing it is due to cost. Plasma-Lyte is about twice the cost of normal saline ($1 per liter of normal saline and ~ $2.15 for Plasma-Lyte). I have worked with anesthesiologists who will interchange between Plasma-Lyte and normal saline (i.e., one bag of Plasma-Lyte and then one bag of normal saline) to maximize the benefits while minimizing the cost.&#160;

Is Plasma-Lyte available in your current clinical areas?

:::
### Response 7 (Janet Rozek)

Hi Pheobe,&#160;

To reply to your question, my center does not utilize Plasma Lyte in our OR&#39;s. In most cases we start with Normal Saline and then often switch to Ringers.&#160; &#160;

Those would be the two most common fluids used unless blood products are required. I will ask my anesthesia team to see if that would be something we should consider!

Thanks for all the great info !&#160;

## Question

Question 13: Discuss the latest research comparing colloids to crystalloids.
### Response 1 (Kurt Protacio)

In surgical anesthesia, colloids and crystalloids are widely used intravenous (IV) fluids with the goal of managing and maintaining adequate blood volume and perfusion of oxygen during surgery and/or procedures. Historically, during World War II, colloid infusions such as albumin, specifically human albumin solution (HAS), were used to resuscitate trauma/burn victims, leading to increased blood volume expansion and blood pressure (Featherstone &amp; Ball, 2023). On the other hand, crystalloid infusions such as 0.9% normal saline (NS) was primarily used in fluid resuscitation during the Cholera epidemic in the 1800s (Fernandez-Sarmiento et al., 2023). Today, the field has been evolving exponentially, and along with it, pathways to govern optimal IV fluid administration such as the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery model (ERAS) (Miller &amp; Myles, 2019). But what IV fluid should be used? Many argue that the primary IV fluid for all major surgeries should be an isotonic, balanced crystalloid such as lactated Ringer’s or Plasma-Lyte, as it closely aligns with plasma electrolytes and acid-base equilibrium (Miller &amp; Myles, 2019). Other solutions like 0.9% saline (NS) should be avoided in major surgeries as its association to hyperchloremic acidosis is evident in many clinical trials. Here is a quick review of crystalloids and colloids:

&#160;

Crystalloids

Consists of water and smaller molecules
Distributes easily past the glycocalyx and throughout the body, filling both intravascular and interstitial spaces (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023)
Excess crystalloid administration can lead to peripheral edema and dilutional coagulopathy (Nunes et al., 2021)
Often the first-line fluid choice in perioperative settings due to low cost and nontoxic properties (Hahn, 2016).

&#160;

Colloids

Consists of larger molecules; cannot pass through glycocalyx
Assists in treating hypovolemic patients by offering longer-lasting intravascular expansion (Secher &amp; van Lieshout, 2016)
Causes more anaphylaxis, renal, and coagulation effects
Designed to mimic plasma viscosity, leading to preservation of capillary pressure needed to maintain perfusion during surgery (Boer et al., 2018)

&#160;

I’ve added an in-depth, comparison table of modern applications of crystalloids and colloids that I have summarized from Hahn’s Clinical Fluid Therapy in the Perioperative Setting (2016):

&#160;

Topic

Crystalloids

Colloids

Spinal Anesthesia

Pros:

Inexpensive
Generally safe with low risk of allergic reactions
May be given immediately after induction

Cons:

Offer limited effectiveness in treating hypotension with larger volumes

Pros:

Offer better preload support
Can be combined with the most appropriate vasopressor for blood pressure stabilization (Goal-directed fluid therapy)
Low albumin serves as an important perioperative predictor of postoperative complications (Campos et al., 2021)

Cons:

Expensive
Avoid larger volumes (&gt;15ml/kg) in elderly and obstetric patients (pre-eclampsia) to prevent hypervolemic symptoms

Neurosurgery

Pros:

Hypertonic saline (3%) preferred over colloid solutions for its osmotic effect in reducing brain edema intraoperatively
Isotonic solutions (Plasma-Lyte) can also be used as volume maintenance*

Cons:

Risk of electrolyte imbalance

&#160;

*Evidence remains limited for supporting use of isotonic solutions

Pros:

None

Cons:

Usually contraindicated to prevent risk of increased intracranial pressure (ICP)

Cardiac Surgery

Pros:

Isotonic solutions (Lactated Ringer’s, Plasma-Lyte) preferred during bypass to reduce electrolyte imbalances*

Cons:

May cause hypervolemia through volume overload, not oncotic imbalance
May cause imbalance to the endothelial layer with larger volumes by diluting the blood components, further exacerbating the inflammatory response

&#160;

*Evidence regarding mortality is mixed in terms of survival of cardiac patients, leading to careful use of crystalloids and colloids peri-, intra-, and post-operatively on a case-by-case basis (Qureshi &amp; Mariscalco, 2016)

Pros:

Smaller infusion volumes offer blood pressure and volume stability, minimizing fluid overload – a concern with large crystalloid volumes
Provide endothelial protection by stabilizing plasma volume

Cons:

Can increase risk of capillary leak syndrome (CLS) due to loss of interstitial oncotic pressure
Current research suggests that CLS is associated with certain colloids, predisposing patients to pulmonary edema, especially with patients on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)
Use with caution to prevent peripheral edema and increased blood volume expansion

Abdominal Surgery

Pros:

Generally safer in maintaining kidney function in normovolemic patients
Less expensive
Consider using if extensive fluid resuscitation is needed

Cons:

Avoid hypotonic solutions (NS) to prevent acidosis
May require larger volumes to achieve same volume expansion as albumin, leading to tissue edema and destabilization of bowel anastomosis
Ineffective in treating hypotension caused by epidural blocks. Best treated with vasopressor support (Brandstrup, 2016)

Pros:

Albumin and hydroxyethyl starch (HES) has been beneficial for liver transplantation by maintaining colloid osmotic pressure longer than crystalloids (Brandstrup, 2016)
Faster bowel recovery with smaller volumes compared to crystalloids
Total volume of fluid administered intraoperatively, and net fluid balance were significantly lower compared to crystalloids (Joosten et al., 2018)

Cons:

HES is used cautiously due to increased risk of acute kidney injury (AKI)

Orthopedic Surgery

Pros:

Used widely during initial volume replacement (minor to moderate blood loss)*

&#160;

Cons:

Can lead to edema and potential compartment syndrome with excessive administration
Edema can prolong wound healing and recovery of orthopedic patients (Jakobsson, 2016)

&#160;

*Use of goal directed fluid therapy (GDFT) protocol is recommended as there is no specific fluid resuscitation algorithm currently available

Pros:

Albumin and gelatin colloids can sometimes be used as an adjunct if larger volume expansion is needed (significant blood loss, hypoalbuminemia)

Cons:

Increased risk of bleeding especially at high doses

Trauma/Hypovolemic Shock

Pros:

Isotonic solutions used to manage initial volume loss
Generally cheaper and readily accessible

Cons:

0.9% NS can cause hyperchloremic acidosis, potentially leading to renal vasoconstriction and impairment.

Pros:

Effective plasma volume expander
Longer intravascular retention, resulting in less repeated infusions
Colloids Versus Crystalloids for the Resuscitation of the Critically Ill (CRISTAL) study resulted in better survival rates after 90 days when critically ill patients with hypovolemic shock received colloids (Evans, 2015)

Cons:

expensive
Avoid HES due to increased AKI concerns
May impair coagulation factors, a concern in trauma patients

Ocular Surgery

Pros:

Considered but not mandatory for ocular surgeries that are best performed under general anesthetic (GA) such as orbital tumor removal, orbital decompression, or orbital fracture repairs (Ye et al., 2018)

Rarely used due to anaphylactic, osmotic and coagulation effects

Pediatric Surgery

Pros:

Intraoperative bleeding is common, thus resulting in the use of crystalloid infusions to treat extracellular fluid (ECF) deficit
Isotonic solutions with 1-2% glucose can be
For minor procedures, run maintenance infusions plus extra volumes of 10-20ml/kg as needed to replace ECF or blood loss (S&#252;mpelmann &amp; Dennhardt, 2016)

Cons:

NS can cause unwanted bicarbonate dilution and hyperchloremic acidosis
RL becomes slightly hypotonic during infusions&#160; and can lead to increased ICP
&#160;

Pros:

Used to minimize interstitial fluid overload
Recent studies show that HES and synthetic gelatin solutions have shown to be as effective and safe in restoring hemodynamics, and are less costly (S&#252;mpelmann &amp; Dennhardt, 2016)
Doses of 10-20ml/kg were considered safe when infusing HES 130 undergoing pediatric cardiac surgery (Van der Linden et al., 2015)

Cons:

HES should be the last colloid solution to be used in the perioperative setting due to its history of adverse coagulation effects in children (S&#252;mpelmann &amp; Dennhardt, 2016)

### Response 2 (Junia Isaac)

Hi Kurt,

&#160;

You’ve provided a fantastic overview of colloids and crystalloids with historical insights and current applications! Your point on the Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) model guiding optimal IV fluid choice is especially relevant given recent studies on patient-specific factors (Miller &amp; Myles, 2019). For instance, in sepsis management, crystalloids are increasingly preferred due to the renal risks associated with synthetic starches in colloids (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023).

&#160;

This raises a question about fluid choice&#39;s role in patient-centered outcomes. How might factors like postoperative recovery time or hospital stay be influenced by fluid type? Additionally, considering the ERAS model, balanced crystalloids like Plasma-Lyte and Lactated Ringer’s have been shown to reduce electrolyte imbalances, but are there clinical scenarios where colloids might still be favoured despite these benefits?

&#160;

Your comparison across various surgical contexts is incredibly informative, offering valuable insights for making practical, patient-centered decisions in fluid management. Your points on cardiac and abdominal surgery highlight the complex decision-making required in fluid management. In cardiac surgeries, where minimizing volume overload is critical due to the risk of postoperative heart strain, it’s fascinating that colloids, with their smaller infusion volumes, can help reduce fluid overload compared to crystalloids (Hahn, 2016). In abdominal procedures, the potential for tissue edema with crystalloid use raises questions about how to best maintain kidney function without exacerbating the risk of edema and anastomosis issues (Hahn, 2016). How do clinicians effectively balance this fluid choice to avoid overload while also ensuring stable hemodynamics and tissue perfusion? Are there specific monitoring techniques that can aid in this delicate balance, especially in high-risk cases?

&#160;

Regarding trauma care, your mention of the Colloids Versus Crystalloids for the Resuscitation of the Critically Ill&#160;(CRISTAL) study is thought-provoking. While it shows survival benefits with colloid use, other studies question the cost-effectiveness and long-term impacts of colloids versus crystalloids, particularly in resource-limited settings (Evans, 2015). Given this, are there guidelines or recent studies that explore balancing efficacy with cost in trauma scenarios, especially considering colloids’ higher expense and potential long-term risks?

&#160;

Thanks again for such a thorough response – your analysis really adds depth to this topic!

### Response 3 (Paula Watkis)

Hi Kurt,

You have provided a very detailed overview of colloids and crystalloids. I completely agree with your points and does not have much to add. Your breakdown really highlights how the choice between colloids and crystalloids depends on the clinical scenario, patient&#39;s fluid status and the goals of treatment. Intravascular hypovolaemia and fluid overload are both harmful and associated with organ dysfunction.&#160;It is important to note that colloid or crystalloid administration must tailored to each patient. For e.g. the use of buffered crystalloid solutions over 0.9% saline is&#160;recommended in patient undergoing kidney transplantation. The patient&#39;s ability to tolerate will vary as such that the same type and volume of fluid can have different clinical effects especially if there is associated acute and chronic comorbidities. They both have benefits and risks in differing patient population and physicians should use them cautiously as they would with any intravenous drug. The use of colloids is not advantageous over crystalloid solutions with respect to hemodynamic effects.&#160; Its use is associated with increased mortality in patients with traumatic brain injury. Therefore, specific fluid should be chosen based on indications, contraindications and potential toxic effects in order to maximize efficacy and minimize toxicity (John &amp; Mythen, 2013). There are mixed reviews on the use and outcomes of both colloid and crystalloids.&#160;

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, Kurt, for the in-depth research.

This topic requires further research as controversies still remain. Generally, anesthesia opts for crystalloids wherever possible, and medicine may opt for colloids. Therefore, we tend to see more normal saline, Ringer’s lactate, or Plasma-Lyte in the operating rooms and Albumin only in the ICU. The one thing we can definitely agree on is that although both crystalloid and colloid solutions can improve perfusion, they have no oxygen-carrying capacity like blood products. &#160; &#160;

In the past, I have given some synthetic colloids such as Voluven and Pentaspan (both hydroxyethyl starches). Lately, however, the use of colloids in anesthesia has decreased dramatically. Studies have shown inconsistent findings on the benefits of colloids. There are also studies indicating that there is not much difference between the intraoperative use of colloids and crystalloids. Some anesthesiologists believe that the volume expansion property with colloids is just a temporary fix and that crystalloids work equally as well. They usually would go straight from crystalloids to blood when indicated. In addition, studies have also suggested that synthetic colloids have substantial side effects. Because of all these reasons, their use in the operating room has decreased. &#160;

**Blood Management Protocols**

&#160;&#160;&#160; Protocols for perioperative blood management include

(1) Multimodal protocols or algorithms: Algorithms are intended to identify decision points or “pathways” during a procedure

(2) Restrictive versus liberal transfusion criteria: Strategy used to reduce transfusion requirements.

(3) Avoidance of transfusion: Protocol to reduce the volume of blood loss.

(4) A massive (i.e., hemorrhage) transfusion protocol: Life-threatening hemorrhage after trauma and/or during a procedure

(5) Maximal surgical blood order schedules: strategy to improve the efficiency of blood ordering practices (American society of anesthesiologist, (ASA) 2014)

&#160;

&#160;&#160; **Massive Transfusion Protocols: ***&#160;*Massive transfusion protocols are implemented in cases of life-threatening hemorrhage after trauma and/or during a procedure and are intended to minimize the adverse effects of hypovolemia and dilutional coagulopathy.

&#160;&#160; In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, preoperative anaemia should be identified, evaluated and managed to minimise RBC transfusion. All surgical patients should be evaluated as early as possible to manage and optimise haemoglobin and iron stores (ASA, 2014).

&#160;&#160;

**Production of blood cells**

&#160; &#160;&#160;Red blood cells, most white blood cells and platelets are produced in the bone marrow. Lymphocytes are also produced in the lymph nodes and spleen. All blood cells originate from stem cells in the bone marrow, which divide into immature cells that mature into red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. The rate of blood cells production is controlled by the body’s needs (Sarode, 2024).

Guideline for blood transfusion in operating room (Association for the Advancement of Blood &amp; Biotherapies, 2024).

Indications for transfusion such as assessment of hemoglobin and blood loss.
Appropriate blood product selection based on patient’s needs.
Ensure blood type and cross match are performed.
Pre-transfusion check with two qualified staff members.
Administer at appropriate rate with a dedicated blood transfusion set as per protocol.
Document all relevant information including the product type, volume, start and end times and any reactions.
Post-transfusion care to continue monitoring for delayed reactions.

### Response 2 (Reneerose Ong)

Your post does a fantastic job outlining the key aspects of blood product transfusion and the protocols used in surgical settings. I especially appreciate how clearly you explained the different types of blood products and their components, along with their shelf lives. It’s such crucial information, and you made it easy to understand.

Highlighting perioperative blood management strategies and the use of multimodal algorithms emphasizes the importance of a structured approach to transfusion. The emphasis on massive transfusion protocols and the need for early anemia management in cardiac surgery patients reflects the proactive measures needed to improve patient outcomes.

Your detailed breakdown of transfusion guidelines, from selecting the right blood product to monitoring for delayed reactions, reflects what is done at my institution. I’m curious—have you ever faced challenges sticking to these protocols in high-pressure situations? I&#39;d love to hear how you&#39;ve navigated those moments.

### Response 3 (Mary Johnsy Joseph)

Hi Reene

Thank you for the feedback. There are moments happened in my experience in operating room and&#160; protocol adherence can be challenging, especially during massive transfusions or in urgent trauma cases. In trauma cases, blood may need to be transfused rapidly to save the patient’s life. The MTP protocol is often activated, we have a MTP code that can be activated, same like we call call code blue, but this is code massive transfusion and this process involves the use of pre-packaged, crossmatched blood products. As a circulating nurse, my responsibility is to make sure a group and cross match was done prior to all emergency surgeries or surgery with possibility of high blood loss. In these situations, it’s easy to feel rushed or overwhelmed, but sticking to stay calm, communicate and be consistent with protocols to prevent errors, priority is patient&#39;s safety.

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

I want to clarify that plasma and cryoprecipitate are frozen below -18oC for storage. Once thawed, they can be stored at 1 – 10oC for 24 hours for plasma and 4 hours for cryoprecipitate. On the other hand, platelets are stored at room temperature. One of my pet peeves is seeing anesthesiologists pack all blood products, including platelets, into the same ice cooler after blood-checking. Keeping platelets in their container without ice is important to preserve their function. Cooled platelets will be rapidly cleared by hepatic macrophages and removed from circulation.

The production of blood products involves the following several key steps to ensure safety, quality, and effectiveness:

Blood collection
Processing&#160;

The first centrifugation separates whole blood into its components: red blood cells (RBCs), plasma, and buffy coat (platelets and white blood cells (WBCs).
Buffy coats from 4 donors are then combined and centrifuged a second time to separate WBCs, resulting in a pooled platelet concentrate.
Plasma is centrifuged a second time to separate the precipitate (cryoprecipitate) from the liquid portion.

Testing – Each unit of blood is tested for infectious diseases and blood type to ensure safety and compatibility.
Storage at appropriate temperature.&#160;

The guidelines for use in the operating room are summarized in the following chart:

RBC&#160;

To improve oxygen-carry capacity to tissues and organs

Plasma

To correct coagulopathy when specific factor concentrates are not available
Urgent reversal of Warfarin

Platelets

concentrate

Thrombocytopenia with bleeding
Platelet dysfunction
To control or prevent bleeding with surgical procedures

Cryoprecipitate

Inherited disorders of fibrinogen
Acquired hypofibrinogenemia due to liver transplant, postpartum hemorrhage, and trauma
Used is mainly replaced with fibrinogen concentrates

Whole blood

Massive hemorrhage where rapid volume replacement is needed

A quick note on whole blood. Although it has the advantages of containing oxygen-carrying capacity and has a reduced risk of hypofibrinogenemia and other coagulopathies associated with transfusing RBCs alone, we don’t routinely transfuse whole blood during surgical procedures. The only situation for transfusing whole blood that I can think of is during autologous blood transfusion. This is when a patient donates their own for surgery, and in this situation, there is no need to separate anything. Autologous blood transfusion is discussed in Minna’s post on Question 20. &#160;

Lastly, I want to add that even following a proper storage process, the quality of blood products will decrease with time. For example, factors V and VIII can be degraded in plasma. Also, blood storage will decrease 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, increasing hemoglobin&#39;s affinity for oxygen and making less oxygen available for tissues. Cell metabolism within the blood product during storage can also cause electrolyte imbalances after transfusion. For example, the citrate in the preservative as an anticoagulant may cause metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia. This is due to the metabolism of citrate to bicarbonate and the binding of citrate to calcium. Therefore, we should try to use fresh blood whenever possible for critically ill patients. &#160;

## Question

Question 15: What factors determine whether a red blood cell transfusion is indicated during surgery?
### Response 1 (Adrian Harris)

A recent systematic review on decision-making for transfusion suggests there are varying guidelines for when to transfuse (1). A gap exists for supporting evidence in the practice guidelines around RBC transfusion in the intraoperative environment (1).&#160; Nonetheless, there are several factors and clinical practice guidelines that are most often utilized (2).&#160;

&#160;

The decision to intraoperatively transfuse red blood cells (RBC) can be made based on a variety of different indicators:

&#160;

1.&#160; Two schools of thought of patient blood management (PBM) for transfusion predominate: a more liberal approach and a more restrictive approach (2)

&#160;

Liberal approach – transfuse despite hemoglobin (Hgb) more than 100 g/L (2)

There is thought that patients under anesthesia may have an inability to compensate for under-adequate oxygen delivery; one meta-analysis suggested that liberal approach transfusion improved overall survival rates (2)

Restrictive approach – the more favoured approach – transfuse when Hgb &lt; 70 g/L;

this approach was noted as more commonly and generally used intraoperative guideline in the literature reviews (2)
Transfuse with Hgb &lt; 80 g/L for patients having cardiac surgery, orthopedic surgery or if the patient has any cardiovascular disease (3)

&#160;

2.&#160; The type of surgery performed and its’ expected estimated blood loss (EBL), and likelihood of transfusion (2)

&#160;

There is an increased likelihood of transfusion in patients who are:

Female
Anemic
Older in age
Lower in weight
Undergoing an urgent surgery
Experiencing renal dysfunction (3)

Certain surgeries are expected to have EBL than others (trauma, vascular) (4)
Consensus on EBL is that there is no consistency or standard to predicting estimated intraoperative blood loss (1); in fact, between different institutions and even between anesthesia and surgeons, there appears to be differences in how each will estimate expected blood loss (3)
Actual blood loss can also be estimated (although it’s not incredibly accurate) using:

Estimates for blood in surgical sponges
Blood in suction devices
Blood in surgical drapes (2)

There is also a way to determine how much blood loss should occur before a transfusion is considered, called the maximal allowable blood loss (MABL) (5)
MABL is especially important in pediatric or neonatal cases where small losses of blood volume may have an even greater clinical impact
Using a patient’s hematocrit (the percentage proportion of the blood volume occupied by RBC) (6), MABL is calculated before anesthetic is given and can be used as part of comprehensive patient blood management when determining if transfusion is needed
MABL for an intraoperative patient, uses the initial and the last (or what would be the minimal accepted) hematocrit (Hct) values, and the patient’s estimated blood volume (EBV) using the following equation: (5)

&#160;

MABL (in mL) = EBV x (initial Hct % – last Hct %) / initial Hct % (5)

&#160;

Where EBV = patient’s weight in kilograms (kg) x estimated mean blood volume (mL/kg), using Table 1 below

&#160;

Age

&#160;

&#160;

For example, MABL for a 10 kg pediatric patient who is 2 years old, with a starting Hct of 40% that drops to 30% during an orthopedic case, will be:

&#160;

MABL (in mL) = EBV x (initial Hct % – last Hct %)/initial Hct %

&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; = (75 x 10) (40 – 30)/40

&#160;

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; = 187.5 mL

&#160;

3.&#160; The patient’s pre-operative hemoglobin (Hgb) level and their ability to tolerate intra-operative anemia

&#160;

Normal compensatory mechanisms to anemia (decreased Hgb) are vasoconstriction and increased cardiac output, which could be masked by the effects of anesthesia or be limited by age or current comorbidities (e.g. an elderly patient with coronary artery disease) (2)

&#160;

4.&#160; Acute hemorrhage is occurring (3)

&#160;

During active bleeding, maintain hemoglobin &gt;70 g/L
Consider hemodynamic instability, the rate of bleeding, evidence of tissue ischemia (e.g. acidosis), institutional speed of blood delivery when determining how many units should be transfused (3)
Ensure prompt blood availability when hemoglobin is &lt;80 g/L (3)

&#160;

5. Expected increase in Hgb and outcome of transfusion (3)

&#160;

Red Blood Cells (RBC)

&#160;

&#160;

&#160;

Taking into consideration these factors will assist an anesthesia provider in determining whether intraoperative transfusion of RBC is necessary.&#160;

### Response 2 (Junia Isaac)

Hi Adrian, your post provides an insightful framework for transfusion decisions, especially in addressing the two main approaches to patient blood management (PBM) and the factors influencing intraoperative transfusion thresholds (Baker et al., 2021). Building on your points about hemoglobin (Hgb) levels and surgical type, I was wondering if you&#39;ve encountered any studies that highlight dynamic indicators, like thromboelastography, which can guide intraoperative transfusion based on real-time coagulation status rather than EBL alone (Giustini &amp; Dachsangvorn, 2023). This could be particularly useful in cases where traditional blood loss estimation methods, such as visual estimates from sponges or drapes, may be less accurate or subjective.

&#160;

Additionally, I appreciate your detailed exploration of maximal allowable blood loss (MABL) calculations, especially for pediatric and neonatal patients where volume shifts can have significant clinical impacts. To further refine this decision-making process, some guidelines suggest individualized thresholds for patients with comorbidities like cardiovascular disease, where restrictive transfusion targets may need to be adjusted (Shimabukuro &amp; Miller, 2023). Have you come across specific evidence or protocols in the literature that discuss alternative targets for high-risk groups?

&#160;

The way you outlined transfusion volumes, particularly in terms of expected Hgb increase for both adults and pediatric patients, is quite useful. Given the variability in patient response to transfusion, I wonder if ongoing studies are looking into how predictive models might help estimate transfusion outcomes more accurately.

### Response 3 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, Adrian, for an in-depth discussion on red blood cell transfusion indications.&#160;

The restrictive approach is definitely the common practice where transfusion is only indicated once the hemoglobin level drops to 70 g/L. More important than the 70 g/L threshold is the patient’s ability to tolerate intraoperative anemia, as Adrian pointed out. It may be appropriate to transfuse with higher 70 g/L hemoglobin in patients showing signs or symptoms of impaired oxygen delivery, such as cardiac ischemia, tachycardia, and hypotension. On the other hand, patients with a low risk of ischemia can tolerate a lower threshold.

It is always good practice to follow blood conservation strategies as they reduce transfusion risks, improve patient outcomes, and are more cost-efficient. Blood conservation can start preoperatively by investigating and treating preexisting anemia, because there is a strong association between the patient’s preoperative hemoglobin and the risk of transfusion. Weeks before surgical procedures, patients can be prescribed iron therapy and erythropoietin to optimize red cell mass. Anticoagulants should also be stopped 10 days before the surgical procedure. In addition, we can consider using cell salvage, administering tranexamic acid, and other strategies to prevent blood loss intraoperatively.&#160;

# Question 16

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3281/View)

## Question

Question 16: Once the blood products are processed and brought to the operating room, detail the procedure for checking blood products before administration to a patient.
### Response 1 (Shawn Page)

Once the blood has been received from the lab, three patient identifiers need to be checked (with medications it is typically okay for only two identifiers), so the pt name, date of birth, and hospital ID number need to be confirmed by two regulated healthcare professionals.&#160; As per Canadian Blood Services, their document only states two patient identifiers need to be checked (O’Reilly, 2020).&#160;

Blood product type and expiry date is also confirmed by both health care professionals.&#160; The pts chart must also be examined to make sure the correct blood type and Rh status blood has been sent to the OR.

The donor numbers on the product container will also be confirmed. The donor number on the removable stickers, needs to be compared to the donor number on the preprinted label on the blood product that contains the pt identifiers (that was printed and attached in the blood lab).&#160; A sticker is removed from the RBC bag and placed onto some sort of &quot;Blood/blood products administration record&quot; paper, that will also have pt preprinted, demographics, or a pt identifier sticker attached to it.

The pt identifiers need to be checked on the chart (paper or electronic), compared with the pt identifier sticker/pre printed blood administration record sheet, and the pt identifier on the blood product bag with the pt identifier sticker attached in the blood bank.&#160;&#160;

&#160;In Canada the following regulated healthcare professionals can administer blood and check the blood prior to administration – registered nurses, registered respiratory therapist, clinical perfusionist, anesthesia assistant, nurse practitioner, critical care paramedics (in some jurisdictions advanced care paramedic), medical doctor.

Summary:

-blood enters the room

-place a pt sticker on the blood administration sheet

-place a donor number sticker from the blood product bag onto the blood administration record sheet

-open the chart and confirm the pts full name, check the full name on the identifier sticker (that&#39;s already on the blood administration record), check the full name on the pt label on the blood product bag

-confirm the pts date of birth in the chart, compare with the date of birth on the pt sticker, confirm date of birth on the blood product

-confirm MRN (or another identifier) in the chart, compare this with the pt identifier sticker, compare this with the pt label on the blood

-compare the blood donor number from the removeable sticker (that is already on the blood administration record sheet) and compare it with the donor number on the pt label on the blood product bag

-look in pts chart for pts blood type and RH status and compare this to the same on the label of the blood product

-look at the expiry date of the blood product

-do all this with a partner, and when all of this is satisfactory, BOTH staff members sign the blood administration record sheet

Some blood products cannot stay out of the fridge for too long (RBC),and some may stay in the room for a certain amount of time ie. FFP, platelets, so the recommendations from Canadian Blood Services and the organization&#39;s policy and procedures must be known.&#160; Some organizations want platelets to be placed on a &quot;rocker&quot; that keeps the product rocking back and forth until they are used, and some organizations no longer do this.

The following also needs to be determined prior administration:

Type of product to be administered (after the pt identifiers have been checked, the chart needs to be checked for the pts blood type – ABO and Rh – and the results compared to the label on the RBC)
Volume or amount to be administered
Rate of infusion or duration (some institutions may reference a procedure that defines a standard administration rate)
Date and time of transfusion
Sequence in which products are to be transfused (when multiple products are ordered together)&#160;
Use of pressure infusion devices when indicated
Use of blood warmers when indicated, these are almost always to be considered in the operating room, unless it is an emergent transfusion and a blood warmer was not set up and flushed before the case
Modifications, if any, to blood components
Special transfusion requirements, if any i.e.. Through a peripheral or central line, or directly through the cardio-pulmonary bypass machine
Medications related to the transfusion, if required, including dosage, route and when to administer the medication (i.e., pre-, intra- or post-transfusion).&#160;
E.g., Pre-medication, such as diphenhydramine and/or acetaminophen, may be considered if the patient has a documented history of previous transfusion reactions. Pre-medication should be administered at a suitable time to allow for effectiveness before transfusion.
E.g., Intra- or post-medication, such as furosemide, may be considered if the patient is at increased risk for fluid overload complications
Confirmation that blood tubing has been primed with normal saline
Confirmation that anesthesia wants the orange blood filter insitu or not (it seems newer anesthetists are foregoing blood filters insitu (O’Reilly, 2020)

### Response 2 (Reneerose Ong)

Thanks, Shawn, for the thorough explanation of the process for checking blood products before administering them in the operating room. The approach you described closely mirrors the procedure we use at my current institution. However, since switching to EPIC as our electronic health record (EHR) system, we&#39;ve streamlined the workflow further. With EPIC, scanning the blood product provides an extra layer of verification alongside the standard two-person checks.

Additionally, as part of our two-person verification, we ensure there is documentation in the patient’s chart confirming that informed consent for the transfusion has been obtained from the patient or their family.

Does your institution allow both regulated healthcare professionals to perform these checks together? At my workplace, there’s a strong emphasis on the &#39;alone and apart&#39; method, where each professional independently verifies the details in the physical presence of the patient i.e. at patient bedside/ in operating room. Both professionals then sign off on the EHR or, in cases of paper-based orders, on the blood transfusion record. I&#39;m curious if this &#39;alone and apart&#39; practice is a standard requirement across different institutions or if it’s more specific to pediatric settings?

### Response 3 (Shawn Page)

Hi Reneerose,

Thanks for your post and question.&#160; We use epic as well, and from my post the only extra step I would add is that we also scan all products before we administer them.&#160; We will have to paper blood administration record paperwork though.

I have never heard of an &quot;alone&quot; blood check.&#160; We have always just done it with each person standing side by side at the computer.&#160; So, I&#39;m sorry but I cannot comment on if we &quot;can&quot; do an apart confirmation or not.

Before the pt enters our OR, we do a safety debriefing and the surgeon will say that the pt has agreed to blood/products, and one of the RNs will say something like &quot;blood consent paperwork has been seen and is signed by the pt&quot;, and then the surgeon continues with their surgical plan.&#160; Once the pt is in the room, another time out will occur and again, the surgeon will announce something like &quot;Pt has agreed to blood&quot;, or &quot;pt has agreed to blood, but only from the cell saver&quot; or any other specifications to blood administration ie. Pt is Jehovah Witness so will NOT accept anything, or will only accept A... B... and C. etc.&#160; At the time an RN will announce that they have checked the fridge and 2 units of RBC are available.

Also, when anesthesia and I meet and assess the pt, the anesthetist will review the possibility of blood administration, or not, with the pt.&#160; So the surgical team has had A LOT of opportunity to check for pts approval for blood administration.

I am interested in your stand alone double check, that&#39;s really interesting.&#160; The only medication we do that for is insulin.&#160; Thanks fir sharing!

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Great overview, Shawn! Checking blood products will be one of the basic skills that you will be signing off on in clinical and will be something that we’ll practice in next semester’s simulations.

In the operating rooms at UHN, we do not use the &#39;alone and apart&#39; method. We are required to perform two independent checks (not necessarily apart) by qualified clinicians, one of whom will be responsible for initiating the transfusion.&#160;

Regarding positive patient identification, we must confirm the patient information on the blood product label exactly matches the patient’s chart and the patient’s attached ID band. However, checking the patient&#39;s ID band sometimes may not be possible in the operating rooms because the patient’s arms may be tugged under the sterile drapes. In Toronto General Hospital (TGH), the nurse will put the patient’s ID band around the infusing IV line so that it is visible for checks. The infusing IV line is directly connected to the patient so we treat it as part of the patient. We also pre-check patient-specific stickers or hospital cards against the ID band prior to surgery.&#160;

I also want to point out that at shift change or for any reason that the blood products are removed from the operating room or left unattended after the checks, we should also do a check again. In TGH, we have two people checking the blood products once they enter the operating room and a third check again just prior to hanging the blood. The checked blood products are kept in the cooler. A friendly reminder is to keep the platelets separate from the pack red blood cells (PRBCs) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP). Platelets are stored at 20oC - 24oC&#160;and should never be chilled as this will lead to rapid clearance by hepatic macrophages. Platelets usually come with their own cooler without an ice pack, whereas the cooler for PRBCs and FFP has an ice pack. Unfortunately, the coolers look identical from the outside (at least at our institution). I have seen platelets misplaced accidentally in the wrong cooler before.

:::
### Response 5 (Kelly Gram)

It is very interesting to hear the differences and similarities between institutions when it comes to checking and giving blood. The bulk of my experience running blood was before Epic and our procedure was a two person check with each of us signing the blood record, and initialing the blood product so that when we went to hang it we were able to confirm the unit had been checked by ourselves as that is a requirement that the person hanging it has checked it.&#160;&#160;

During MHP, particularly during a trauma OR, another level of safety we used was to place either a bag or cloth on the ground below the rapid infuser and we kept every bag of blood product or fluid that we delivered so the most responsible anesthetist could confirm numbers and ensure a sticker from each blood product bag ended up on the patient chart (before electronic charting) at the end of the case. It was also a quick visual as I would keep separate piles for PRBC, plasma and platelets so I could quickly relay numbers to anyone inquiring. This was unnecessary in more controlled environments like ICU in most instances but in the OR keeping the blood bags provided another way of confirming what was given.&#160;

I would imagine with Epic charting and scanning now, this extra layer of safety may eliminate the need for keeping blood bags. However I have yet to be the one responsible for giving large volumes of blood products using Epic, so I guess with time and experience I will learn what works best.&#160;

Group and screens samples are required for RBC, plasma, platelets, Rh immune globin (RhIg) and Intravenous Immunoglobin (IVIG)
Make sure samples are not expired

If patient has been transfused with in the previous three month or pregnant or unknown only valid for 96 hours after sample collected
If not transfused previously within last 3 months and not currently pregnant, sample valid for 28 days after sample collection
Neonates and infants need capillary and venous specimen. No cord blood. (Berta, 2020)

**Red Blood cells**

&#160;

&#160;

Patient must receive blood that does not have the antigen(s) to which they have antibody(ies)&#160;

EXAMPLE: Patient with Blood group A can receive blood from a donor with blood group A (no antigen B) or blood group O (lacks all ABO antigens).&#160;

**&#160;**

The plasma antibodies will hemolyze the transfused RBC unit if the corresponding antigen is the same on the surface (Berta, 2020)

### Response 2 (Mary Johnsy Joseph)

Hi Janey,

&#160; &#160;You explained the topic in detail and included the process of grouping and screening for blood products. It is very informative, and thank you for sharing it. The points and charts you used make it easy to understand.&#160;

&#160; I found it interesting that the time to initiate and complete the transfusion of each blood component is different. Liumbruno &amp; Bennardello (2019) explained the following:

&#160;RBCs are not transfused within this 30-minute window, they should be returned to the blood bank to be re-checked or discarded, depending on institutional policies.
Platelets are generally stored at room temperature (20–24&#176;C) and can be transfused within 4 hours of being issued from the blood bank.
Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) is stored at -18&#176;C or lower and is usually thawed before use. Once thawed, FFP must be used within 24 hours.
cryoprecipitate must be thawed before administration and should be transfused within 6 hours of thawing.

&#160; &#160;Blood products that are not administered within the time limits are at increased risk of bacterial contamination, loss of potency, or other complications, so they must be returned to the blood bank for disposal or further evaluation.&#160;

### Response 3 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Great discussion on group and screen! &#160;

Adding to the criteria of returning blood to the lab, there are exceptions to the 30-minute window to begin transfusion if they are kept in a validated storage cooler or fridge. We used coolers that have been validated to maintain RBCs for up to 4 hours. Luckily, we also have a blood fridge in the operating rooms, so we do not need to worry too much about the time constraint to administration or return as we can take it from the fridge when needed.

Regarding group and screen, surgeries with a &gt;10% risk of transfusion will require a group and screen, and any surgery with a &gt;30% risk of transfusion will also require a crossmatch. The surgeries requiring a group and screening do not necessarily need the blood products in the operating room; however, they do need them on standby in case of an emergency. Having a group and screen test for a patient with a risk of transfusion is more cost-effective since the blood product is held in the blood transfusion lab so that it may be available to multiple patients at once.

I echoed Janey about the importance of checking for the expiry on the group and screen. The group and screen is only valid for 3 days at UHN. This is especially important if patients have just received a transfusion because they may develop new antibodies after the transfusion and then become incompatible with the same blood they had just received. We also need 2 samples of group and screen separately ordered, collected, and tested to prevent wrong blood in the tube resulting in administration error. A new group and screen is required on the day of surgery for certain surgeries that will likely need blood products. Usually, group and screen, and crossmatching are done before the patient comes to the operating room. &#160;It is very frustrating and may delay cases when they are not done.&#160;

:::
### Response 4 (Shawn Page)

I am glad that Phoebe mentioned the blood fridge, so yes, it is possible to keep RBCs out of the blood lab for longer periods, unless that are kept cool.I would strongly suggest we all become familiar with the timeframes that each product can be stored at room temperature - per your organizations protocol.&#160; We will have RBCs in the fridge before a pt comes into our OR for a high risk procedure.&#160; We will order platelets and FFP halfway through the procedure (usually for cardiac cases if the surgeon states the pt is &quot;oozie&quot;).&#160; We will typically only keep these two products at room temp for max 2 hours.&#160; We used to have to put platelets on a rocker in the OR until they are used.&#160; About 2 years ago my organization had a lot of changes to the time allowed out of fridge for each type of product.&#160; So I will usually consult the perfusionist to see if it&#39;s time or not to ask for the products to be brought up yet or not, and even ask anesthesia.&#160; Some anesthetists are&#160; a bit more relaxed about the time limits, but I like to do my best to keep to the policy.

# Question 18

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3279/View)

## Question

Question 18: Describe the difference between physical and electronic cross-matching.
### Response 1 (Teresa Nguyen)

Describe the difference between physical and electronic cross-matching.&#160;

Note: physical cross-matching is not to be confused with serologic cross matching.&#160;

Serologic cross matching requires obtaining the donor RBCs and the patient’s plasma or serum (Tholpady &amp; Bai, 2019). Both samples are mixed and centrifuged to observe hemolysis or agglutination (Tholpady &amp; Bai, 2019). Presence of either indicates positive result and presence of an additional antibody - which deems the donor blood to be incompatible (Tholpady &amp; Bai, 2019). On the contrary, physical cross matching focuses on directly mixing recipient and donor blood samples (Time of Care, 2017).&#160;

Note: electronic cross-matching is not to be confused with virtual cross matching.

Virtual cross matching relies on the complete human leukocyte antigen (HLA) typing of the donor and current antibody assessment of the recipient (Morris et al., 2019). This can be performed in minutes which allows for fast decision making (Morris et al., 2019). On the other hand, electronic cross-matching involves a validated computer program to match compatibility of donor and recipient blood (Duncan, 2020).&#160;

Physical Cross-matching&#160;

Physical cross-matching requires mixing a small amount of the patient’s blood with a small amount of the donor’s blood (Time of Care, 2017). These two people have already been screened and should be compatible (Time of Care, 2017). The two amounts of blood are mixed in a container and observed for agglutination (clumping) (Time of Care, 2017). If agglutination occurs, this indicates antibodies on the recipient’s blood binding to donor’s RBCs (Time of Care, 2017). If this is the case, although the type and screen was completed, the clinician will not be able to transfuse the blood because the crossmatching failed (Time of Care, 2017).&#160;

Indications:

Patient has screened positive for some antibodies that could react with donor blood - physical cross matching must be used instead of electronic cross matching (Time of Care, 2017)

Patient had a past history of previous transfusions (Time of Care, 2017)

Electronic Cross-matching

Electronic cross-matching electronically matches the recipient’s and donor’s blood based on antigens from the two bloods (from type and screen) (Time of Care, 2017)

This completely eliminates physically mixing the two bloods together (Time of Care, 2017)

The computer system must contain the blood unit number, component name, donor’s ABO group/Rh type and the recipient’s ABO group/Rh type, and antibody screen results (Tholpady &amp; Bai, 2019)

The system is required to alert the user if it detects ABO/Rh-incompatible blood and therefore, must not issue the donor blood until ABO/Rh is verified (Tholpady &amp; Bai, 2019)

Indications:

Patient and donor blood have matching types (Time of Care, 2017)

The patient’s current antibody screen is negative and there is no history of clinically significant antibody while the donor’s blood cells screen negative for antigens (Duncan, 2020)

### Response 2 (Laryssa Hartmann)

Hi Teresa!&#160;

&#160;

Great overview of the differences between physical and electronic cross-matching. It is interesting to see how technology has evolved in this field, allowing for quicker and more efficient matching process. &#160;

While physical cross-matching can be crucial for patients with complex antibody profiles or those with previous transfusions, electronic cross-matching certainly streamlines the process and reduces the risk of human error. For example, one study tested 323 clinical samples with the Microscanner C3 (an electronic pre-transfusion crossmatch testing system), demonstrating that this electronic method improved the efficiency and reliability of identifying suitable blood samples for transfusions (Park et al., 2024). Ultimately,&#160;enhancing patient safety and optimizing blood product usage in the clinical setting (Park et al., 2024). &#160;

Given these findings, it seems that future advancements in electronic cross-matching could further reduce the reliance on physical cross-matching. What are your thoughts on the future of electronic cross-matching? Do you think physical cross-matching will continue to fade? &#160;

### Response 3 (Junia Isaac)

Thank you, Teresa and Laryssa, for your insightful explanations and perspectives on physical and electronic cross-matching. I appreciate the overview you provided, Teresa, and the way Laryssa highlighted the advancements in electronic cross-matching.

&#160;

Building on these points, I found it fascinating that electronic cross-matching is not only reducing human error but also allowing for significant resource management benefits. For example, some studies indicate that electronic cross-matching systems can lead to reduced blood wastage by quickly identifying the most compatible units and preventing the overuse of rare blood types. In high-demand settings, this efficiency can make a big difference in resource allocation and patient care (Beuschel, 2017).

&#160;

Another interesting aspect is how electronic cross-matching has the potential to further improve during situations where physical cross-matching is limited, like emergency transfusions when there’s minimal time for compatibility tests. However, I wonder if reliance on electronic systems might raise ethical considerations – especially in rural or resource-limited facilities where such technology may not be available.

&#160;

Laryssa, your mention of the Microscanner C3 study raises another thought – what advancements might we see in electronic cross-matching in the next decade? Do you think we might eventually see fully automated systems that require minimal human oversight, or will there always be a need for manual oversight to ensure accuracy? Also, Teresa, based on the importance of physical cross-matching in cases with complex antibody profiles, do you think there are any future developments that could combine both physical and electronic methods to provide a more comprehensive solution? I look forward to hearing everyone’s thoughts!

### Response 4 (Dan Chen)

Hi Teresa,

Thank you for providing a clear overview of both physical and electronic cross-matching processes. It’s fascinating to see how advancements in technology have streamlined blood transfusion practices while maintaining safety standards.

I appreciate your emphasis on the scenarios where physical cross-matching is essential, particularly for patients with a history of transfusions or those who have screened positive for antibodies. These steps are crucial in preventing serious transfusion reactions. The visual assessment for agglutination in physical cross-matching underscores the importance of vigilance in transfusion medicine.

On the other hand, electronic cross-matching represents a significant leap forward. The elimination of physical mixing not only enhances efficiency but also minimizes the risk of human error. As you noted, the automated alerts for ABO/Rh incompatibilities are a vital safety net, ensuring that incompatible blood is not issued.

A new point to consider is the ongoing concerns regarding undetected red blood cell (RBC) antibodies that have limited the adoption of electronic cross-matching in certain regions, such as mainland China. A study examining the missed detection rates of RBC antibodies from 2011 to 2016 highlighted that while electronic cross-matching is efficient, it may overlook unexpected antibodies, particularly in Asian populations. This study found that despite a high compatibility rate in traditional serological cross-matching, unexpected antibodies like anti-Mur alloantibodies were identified. This underscores the need for enhancing the erythrocyte antigenic spectrum, especially for specific antigens, to ensure the safe implementation of electronic cross-matching in diverse populations (Wang, Liu, &amp; Liu, 2019).&#160;

Thank you for sharing!

### Response 5 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Great contribution from everyone! &#160;

I want to dive deeper into the physical (manual) cross-matching. &#160;There are two kinds of physical cross-matching: antiglobulin (full match) and immediate spin (quick match). &#160;The antiglobulin cross-match checks for a standard set of 42 antibodies and is indicated for planned transfusions. It detects unexpected antibodies by incubating the mixture and adding antihuman globulin to see if agglutination occurs. It is the gold standard and takes about 1.5 hours to complete. On the other hand, the immediate spin cross-match is indicated for emergency transfusions. Similar to the electronic cross-match, the immediate spin cross-match is used to verify ABO compatibility only for patients with a negative antibody screen and no history of RBC alloantibodies. The sample is immediately placed in a centrifuge to observe for mixing and takes about 10 minutes to complete.&#160;

Increasingly, we are moving to electronic cross-match because, as you have mentioned, it is quicker to get the result (~ 2 minutes), reduces human error in data interpretation, and is cheaper. This method is particularly favored in settings where speed is crucial, such as emergency departments and high-volume transfusion services. Although electronic cross-match is fast, as you have also highlighted, it relies heavily on accurate data entry and system validation. If the patient has no serology available, physical cross-match is still the only way. Dan also raised the fact that electronic cross-match may not detect all clinically significant antibodies. I am with Junia, wishing for a future development that combines the best of both types of cross-matching.&#160;

### Response 6 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Dan,&#160;

Thank you for highlighting the challenge with electronic cross-matching in certain ethnicities. Studies do demonstrate that Mur and Mia blood group antigens are significantly more prevalent in the Asian population than the Caucasian population. However, due to rarity and high costs of commercial detection reagents, there are unfortunately only few studies done on antigen and antibody detection in large samples. (Li et al., 2022).

Additionally, in routine detection of irregular antibodies, Mur or Mia positive should be included to screen erythrocytes. Also, since Mur and Mia antigens are correlated on red blood cells, by using monoclonal antibodies, we can help predict the presence of the Mur antigen. (Li et al., 2022).

### Response 7 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Laryssa,

&#160;

You and Dan bring up excellent points. I do believe in future advancements and that electronic cross-matching will possibly cause reductions in physical cross-matching. As well as Dan stated, certain populations may require broader antigen panels (e.g. certain populations in China carrying the Mur or Mia antigen). Additionally, I also believe AI may continue to evolve cross-matching and even improve the accuracy of predicting antibody profiles.

&#160;

However, there may also be rural regions or under-developed healthcare settings with lesser technological advancements creating a barrier to advancing to electronic cross-matching.

### Response 8 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Junia,

&#160;

Thank you for raising some ethical considerations into this discussion. In a study during the Covid-19 pandemic, did you know a portable and cost-efficient electrochemical immunosensor was created in order to measure SARS-CoV-2-serum antibodies? Perhaps a similar portable and cost-efficient technology can be created and applied to settings in rural areas and and resource-limited hospitals in regards to cross-matching and detecting complex antibodies.

(Peng et al., 2021).

&#160;

My opinion on a method that combines both physical and electronic methods, is that with technological advancements, I believe a hybrid approach would be ideal and possible. It would incorporate the rapidness of electronic cross-matching while still maintaining and upholding patient safety in regards to the physical cross-matching aspect.

### Response 9 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Phoebe,

&#160;

Thank you for a great overview of the two types of physical cross-matching.

&#160;

I will add on that the antiglobulin cross-match contains 3 phases: immediate spin, 37 degrees Celsius, and AHG (antiglobulin test). &#160;The immediate spin detects antibodies of the IgM class – a drop of red blood cell (RBC) is mixed with 2 drops of the recipient’s plasma and centrifuged. Agglutination is then observed.

(Tholpady, 2019).

&#160;

The tubes are then incubated at 37 degrees Celsius to detect warm reactive antibodies. This step uses low ionic strength saline (LISS) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to speed up antigen-antibody attraction.

(Tholpady, 2019).

&#160;

Lastly, with AHG, tubes are washed 3-4 times with saline and AHG is added to each tube to detect RBC antibodies that do not produce direct agglutination.

(Tholpady, 2019).

## Question

Question 19: Discuss the massive hemorrhage protocol, including the indications and clinical considerations. Provide a personal experience if possible.
### Response 1 (Dong Yue Yu)

Discuss the massive hemorrhage protocol,&#160;including the indications and clinical considerations. Provide&#160;personal&#160;experience if possible.

Massive Hemorrhage Protocol (MHP)

Massive bleeding is the leading cause of death from&#160;&#160;trauma, childbirth, and surgery. It is preventable and require early identification and rapid stabilization through the transfusion of large amount of blood products.

&#160;

A standardized Massive Hemorrhage Protocol (MHP) protocol developed cross all hospital within province in order to expedite the transfusion of blood components based on best practices for the management of massively bleeding patients. majority of the hospital in Ontario has their MHP and include specific team in response to the clinical area.&#160;&#160;

According to Callum, there is 5 % increase in mortality rate associated with each one minute delay of receiving blood products to the trauma patient (2019).

&#160;

*Validated, objective measures for triggering an MHP*

&#160;

*https://professionaleducation.blood.ca/sites/default/files/chapter_11_-_figure_1.png*

&#160;

MHP involves transfusion of a series of predetermined ratio of blood components, Present MHPs strives to give blood component in a ratio to manage hemorrhagic shock, once MHP triggered, blood bank will release box in the following orders for adult patient.&#160;&#160;

Box 1:&#160;&#160;4RBC
Box 2:&#160;&#160;4RBC, 4 Plasma
Box 3:&#160;&#160;4RBC, 2 Plasma, 4g Fibrinogen Concentrate
Box 4:&#160;&#160;4RBC, 2 Plasma

Platelets not included in the box and need to be ordered separately if needed.

&#160;

Several transfusion approach available and there is lack of evidence to suggest one is more beneficial than the other, such as the 1:1:1 (one unit of plasma: one unit of platelets: one unit of red blood cells) blood component strategy as compared to a 1:1:2 (one unit of plasma: one unit of platelets: two units of red blood cells ) blood component strategy (Trudeau JD, Dawe P&amp; Shih AW, 2021).

&#160;

&#160;

Administer tranexamic acid (TXA) within three hours to the traumatically injured patient improves mortality in related to bleeding, Fibrinogen replacement improves survival in trauma patients, fibrinogen concentrate and cryoprecipitate represents the same efficacy and safety base on a RCT trial in cardiac surgery in 2019 (Trudeau JD, Dawe P &amp; Shih AW).

&#160;

My experiences being in the code transfusion cases varies depends on the nurse’s skill level, equipment functionality and team coordination, code transfusion are less occurrence than code blue, therefore, seamless team coordination required to achieve best outcomes. The most effective code transfusion I was take part in involved 5 nurses, two nurses operative the rapid infuser, one do the blood checking and documenting,&#160;&#160;2 more nurses checking and retrieving lab results and stablizing patient. clear direction and closed loop communication are the keys at any crital clinical situations.

### Response 2 (Minna Jin)

Hi Dong Yue,&#160;

&#160;

Thank you for your elaboration on the Massive Hemorrhage Protocol and for sharing your personal experience with it. It is interesting to learn about the different transfusion approaches.&#160;

&#160;

I would also like to share my experience with massive hemorrhage protocol in the ICU.&#160;

To activate a Massive Hemorrhage Protocol, the lead clinician, usually the ICU fellow, completes a Massive Hemorrhage Protocol order set. This includes the requested blood products and quantities, monitoring parameters, and relevant nursing interventions.&#160;
The blood bank is notified of the protocol activation and provided with patient-specific information and the hospital location. The blood bank will issue all ordered blood products, regardless of current laboratory values.&#160;
All blood products are transported in a cooler to prevent spoilage or bacterial growth and they are delivered from blood bank to patient location by a porter.&#160;
All fluids, including crystalloid, RBCs and plasma, are infused via a rapid infuser with in-line warmer. However, platelets cannot be infused using a rapid infuser due to concerns about mechanical shear with high-pressure flow.&#160;
Blood tests, such as CBC, aPTT, PT/INR, fibrinogen activity and ABG should be conducted every one hour (q1h) to monitor hemodynamic stability and guide frequency and quantity of blood transfusion.&#160;
Blood tests such as electrolytes, extended electrolytes, creatinine and liver enzymes are monitored every 4 hours (q4h) or after every 20 blood components administered. Electrolytes are replaced/adjusted as needed.
For an average-sized adult, tranexamic acid is administered as 1g over 10 minutes, followed by another 1g over 8 hours.&#160;
The goal of transfusion:&#160;

(University Health Network, 2024)

Recombinant activated factor VII (rVIIa) should be considered if patient continues to experience massive bleeding
The massive hemorrhage protocol should be terminated when bleeding source control has been attained, hemodynamic stability has been achieved, vasopressor requirements have diminished, and the transfusion rate has slowed such that additional transport personnel are no longer required.

### Response 3 (Ryan Smith)

Dong and Minna

Thanks for your concise recommendations and review of MTP protocols.

For everyone&#39;s consideration, some recommendations for MTP in the trauma setting/en route to OR immediately from a trauma bay/emerg. A trauma team leader friend of mine whom is passionate about appropriate blood product replacement therapy published a recent paper with the aforementioned author Callum (they work at the same hospital) with actionable clinical recommendations regarding MTP:

1. Petrosoniak A, Pavenski K, da Luz LT, Callum J. Massive Hemorrhage Protocol: A Practical Approach to the Bleeding Trauma Patient. Emergency Medicine Clinics of North America. 2023 Feb 1;41(1):51–69.

In summary their recommendations are:

To assist with the decision for MHP activation, the RABT score or critical administration threshold (&gt;3 units/h) is useful.

When hemorrhage is suspected in a trauma patient, 2&#160;g of&#160;TXA (tranexamic acid) should be administered within 3&#160;hours and ideally &lt;1&#160;hour from the injury.

Upon patient arrival, temperature measurement is essential.

After the administration of 3 units of RBCs, begin FFP administration to achieve a 2:1 ratio (RBC:FFP).

### Response 4 (Adrian Harris)

Hi Dong Yue, Minna and Ryan!

&#160;

It’s so great to see that each of our institutions where we work have very similar management of the massive hemorrhage protocol (MHP) so thanks to each of you for sharing the protocols that you utilize.&#160; A couple of the papers you’ve references, Dong Yue and Ryan, were co-authored by staff at who work where I am, and over the time that I’ve been there, the management of MHP has been re-developed and refined as more research has occurred into improving patient outcomes.

&#160;

I happened to be at an MHP in the OR a few weeks ago where I was taking over for a colleague at shift change from nights to days.&#160; The patient was a 40-something male motor vehicle accident who sustained massive orthopedic and traumatic internal injuries, had a positive FAST and was hemodynamically unstable from the time he arrived.&#160;

&#160;

As per trauma room/MHP protocol, the patient had immediately received 2g tranexamic acid (TXA), which is a reversible and synthetic competitive inhibitor to the lysine receptors on plasminogen (1,2). &#160;TXA inhibits plasminogen from converting into plasmin and in turn interrupts plasmin’s role in the breakdown of fibrin clots, slowing overall bleeding (2). (Incidentally, the AAs at my institution also administer TXA in a weight-based dosage, to patients undergoing knee-replacement surgery, based on evidence it reduces the amount of bleeding that occurs and the need for transfusion (2).)

&#160;

For this trauma patient in the OR, I remember mixing and giving 4g of fibrinogen (which doesn’t require additional checking procedure like red blood cells (RBC) against the patient label before infusing). I also continued to run the 2:1 ratio of RBC to plasma via the Belmont rapid infuser with intermittent normal saline to keep the filter and line clear.&#160; I remember looking down at all the empty blood, product and fluid bags and thinking it had been a long time since I’d seen that many.

&#160;

Despite all the team’s efforts, the patient continued to be hemodynamically unstable despite fluid and blood product resuscitation and maximal vasopressor support. &#160;He had profound acidosis with lactates that were “incalculable” &gt; 20 on every arterial blood gas I ran and he began to become more bradycardic and hypotensive.&#160; I remember the trauma surgeon commenting that the anesthesia team had done a great job of resuscitating the patient because he appeared “full”, but I also remember they said his initial blood loss had been so significant that they didn’t anticipate him to survive. As they closed his leg, pelvic, abdominal and chest areas, anesthesia was pushing epinephrine boluses, as the trauma team leader made the decision to call the family to advise that they wouldn’t proceed with CPR when he goes into cardiac arrest.&#160;

&#160;

It was a very well-run team effort over several hours for this trauma patient, with all services working for a positive outcome that never arrived.&#160; Despite the team’s amazing efforts using the evidence-based protocols referred to by Dong Yue, Minna, Ryan and myself, this case was a gentle reminder that there are still going to be times the results won’t be in the patient’s favour.

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, everyone, for sharing your personal experiences!

I want to add that besides just giving blood and tranexamic acid, we should also inquire whether the patient has taken any anticoagulants. We can administer specific antidotes depending on the anticoagulant. For example, we can reverse Unfractionated Heparin with Protamine, Warfarin with Prothrombin or Vitamin K, and Dabigatran with Idarucizumab. &#160;

My Massive Hemorrhage Protocol (MHP) experience was a nick in the inferior vena cava due to a surgical complication. The patient was bleeding massively, with blood continuously dripping off the drapes to the point where we needed to keep on putting blankets on the floor to soak up the blood. I was in charge of the rapid infuser. All I remember was just spiking blood products one after another, pressurizing the rapid infuser chamber, opening and closing clamps. It was basically a race against time to transfuse enough blood to match what was bleeding out.

The MHP is really an all-hands-on-deck situation. As anesthesia assistants (AAs), we definitely play a huge role in MHP, especially intraoperatively. AAs can be involved in setting up and operating the rapid infuser, checking blood, and ensuring adequate vascular access. There should be at least two 16g or larger IVs for blood products and a third for medications. The third IV is necessary because RBCs, platelets, frozen plasma, and cryoprecipitate must not come into contact with anything except normal saline. In addition, AAs can also help prepare and administer pressors and antidotes to anticoagulants. For example, fibrinogen concentrate needs to be reconstituted using sterile water and a micron filter by swirling gently until the concentrate is fully dissolved. Lastly, AAs may be involved in drawing samples for CBC, INR, fibrinogen, and arterial blood gas every hour at the minimum, as Minna indicated.

### Response 6 (Shawn Page)

Hello All,

As someone mentioned it&#39;s great to see very similar protocols in various organizations.&#160; It reassures me that we are all on similar pages.

In my experience we do not usually call a Code Transfusion in the cardiac OR.&#160; Only because we already have so many staff in the room - surgeons, MD assists, RNFAs, RN, RRT, AA, anesthesia, and perfusionists.&#160; If something is &quot;nicked&quot; intra-op we would just go on bypass until the trauma is resolved.

We do, from time to time run a Code Transfusion in our main ORs.&#160; When this occurs part of the protocol is to have a porter come and act as a &quot;runner&quot; between the OR and the lab (for pt sample delivery, and also to bring blood products directly from the blood lab).

During the initial stages one of the RRT/AA will draw off a CBC, lytes and coag panel - PPT, APTT, INR, fibrinogen and hand off to a runner. While this is being done the anesthetist and another RRT/AA start pushing fluids, look for another large bore PIV, if available, and we will also spike levo.

Since I am in a cardiac centre we can run ABG and lytes in the OR, but we still send a sample to the lab.&#160; We can also do a platelet works and we are able to see the amount of available platelets the pt has.&#160; So we can identify if it is a volume issue or a coag issue pretty quickly.&#160; It&#39;s a pretty fast paced first few minutes, but also a pretty organized one because we are all aware of our roles and there is strong communication i.e.&#160; I am drawing off the bloodwork, I am spiking and starting levo, bloodwork has been sent to the lab via porter.&#160; Everyone announces what they are doing currently so we can ensure everything is getting done.

In the spring we had a code transfusion during a routine abdominal surgery (I cannot remember what) and an artery was cut and the pt lost a few liters of blood very quickly.

Once the bloodwork was sent off, a few units of RBC were pumped into the pt, TXA was given, the anesthetist wanted to insert a triple lumen into the right internal jugular.&#160; So while the surgeons continues to work, and the pt was still draped, I ran and got the kit and the ultrasound.&#160; It was kind of cool to have to pass everything to the anesthetist, over the circuit and arm of the AGM, keeping everything sterile all while I was literally standing behind the surgeon.&#160; The line was inserted and we were able to move the blood products and levo line centrally.

## Question

Question 2: Provide the evidence behind the latest approach to perioperative fluid management.
### Response 1 (Tenzing Choedar)

The primary aims of perioperative fluid administration are to sustain or restore normal physiological balance, including proper extracellular and blood volumes to maintain stable cardiac output, adequate end-organ and tissue perfusion, normal metabolic activity, and balanced electrolytes and acid-base levels while avoiding circulatory overload. Proper fluid management can improve patient outcomes by preventing issues like hypovolemia, organ dysfunction, and prolonged recovery (Chiu &amp; Legrand, 2023). Although extensive research has been conducted on perioperative fluid management strategies aimed at optimizing intravascular volume and reducing postoperative complications, a clear consensus on the perfect approach has yet to be established.

Based on my literature review, it seems that perioperative fluid management is not a one size fits all approach. One reason for this shift is that perioperative care has evolved substantially over the past decade, with approaches like laparoscopic/minimally invasive surgeries promoting minimal fluid loss and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) pathways that use restricted fluids becoming standard practices. The leading consensus based on a review article by Miller &amp; Myles (2019) regarding perioperative fluid therapy for major surgery seems to be **moderately liberal, individualized goal directed fluid therapy** approach to maintain a positive balance of 1-2 liters in major surgery and 0-1 liter in minor surgeries. This is further backed up by Perioperative Quality Initiative (POQI), where a group of international multi-professional expert joined together to generate evidence-based consensus recommendations for fluid management in patients undergoing surgery (Ostermann et al., 2024).

The 2023 Canadian Anesthesiologists&#39; Society Guidelines recommend a minimum fasting period of two hours for adults and one hour for children after clear fluids to prevent hypovolemia or dehydration before elective procedures. Preoperative hydration is achieved by avoiding long fasting times, discouraging mechanical bowel prep, and encouraging a clear carbohydrate drink two hours before surgery, promoting a hydrated, euvolemic state upon arrival to the operating room (Kendrick et al. 2019). Assessing a patient’s fluid status accurately can be challenging, but a thorough history and physical exam, along with basic bedside tests like ultrasound or arterial waveform analysis looking at pulse pressure variation or systolic pressure variation, are generally adequate for determining fluid responsiveness (will elaborate more on this below). This means evaluating if additional IV fluids are necessary to increase cardiac output and enhance tissue perfusion. The passive leg raising (PLR) test is an effective predictor of fluid responsiveness due to its simplicity and accessibility, a test I frequently deploy in my ICU to assess cardiogenic shock who is also in septic shock to see if they are fluid responsive. A positive PLR test, indicated by an increase in blood pressure or stroke volume, strongly suggests fluid responsiveness (Miller et al., 2019).

The main rationale for moderately liberal, individualized goal directed therapy is because historically, liberal IV fluid use during major surgeries, particularly abdominal surgeries led to excessive fluid retention and complications. Brandstrup et al. (2003) study found that patients given over 6 liters experienced more weight gain and edema, while those on a restrictive regimen (under 4 liters) had fewer complications and less postoperative weight gain. However, a recent landmark study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Myles et al. (2018), The RELIEF trial, compared restrictive versus liberal fluid regimens in major abdominal surgery. The restrictive fluid intervention was designed to achieve a net zero fluid balance, with a 5 ml/kg bolus at induction of anesthesia followed by an intraoperative crystalloid infusion at a rate of 5ml/kg/h, continued after surgery at 0.8 ml/kg/h for 24 h. In contrast, the liberal group received a 10-ml/kg bolus at induction of anesthesia followed by an intraoperative crystalloid infusion at a rate of 8 ml/kg/h, continued postoperatively at 1.5 ml/kg/h for 24h. The restrictive group on average received a total of 1.7L of fluid intraoperatively with a weight gain of 0.3kg compared with 3L total for liberal group with a weight gain of 3kg. Results showed a higher risk of acute kidney injury in the restrictive group (8.6% vs. 5%), renal replacement therapy (0.9% vs. 0.3%), and surgical site infection (16.5% vs. 13.6%). These findings suggest that a moderately liberal fluid approach, aiming for a positive fluid balance of 1–2 liters at surgery&#39;s end, may be safer to protect the kidneys (Myles et al., 2018). This regimen corresponds to an infusion rate of 10–12 ml/kg/h during surgery and 1.5 ml/kg/h postoperatively, reducing potential harm associated with overly restrictive fluid management (Miller &amp; Myles, 2019).

On the other hand, goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT) is a targeted approach to fluid management in surgery that involves using specific physiological indicators—such as HR, BP, end‐tidal CO2, CVP, urine output, SV, CO, and their derivatives to tailor fluid administration to a patient’s unique needs. By actively monitoring and responding to a patient’s fluid responsiveness, GDT aims to maintain optimal blood flow and oxygen delivery to tissues. This individualized method helps prevent complications associated with both fluid overload and deficit, supporting better recovery outcomes in surgical and critically ill patients. GDT has been associated with improved clinical outcomes based on some clinical investigations (Kendrick et al., 2019). The multicenter FEDORA trial demonstrated that using a goal-directed hemodynamic strategy led to a notable decrease in complications and hospital stay duration. The approach involved initially optimizing the patient&#39;s fluid status to maximize stroke volume, followed by administering a vasopressor or inotrope as needed to maintain a mean arterial pressure above 65 mm Hg and a cardiac index greater than 2.5 L/min/m&#178;.

&#160;

You might be wondering; how do you know if someone is fluid responsive and how does one measure it?

Fluid responsiveness is best predicted by dynamic indices: stroke volume variation (SVV), pulse pressure variation (PPV), and systolic pressure variation (SPV).
A PPV or SVV value of 13% or higher strongly indicates fluid responsiveness.
Dynamic parameters can signal hypovolemia before changes in heart rate (HR), blood pressure (BP), or stroke volume (SV) occur (Miller et al., 2015).

Although these are great indicators of fluid responsiveness, one should not assess them in isolation and give fluid, rather it should be assessed alongside patient’s hemodynamic trends, type of surgery and hemodynamic goals. Fluid therapy should only be given if the anticipated hemodynamic benefit outweighs the associated risks. =

Best way to assess fluid challenge response is by monitoring stroke volume (SV).
A ≥10% increase in SV indicates fluid responsiveness, showing the patient may benefit from additional fluids.
Once on the plateau of the Frank-Starling curve (euvolemic), further fluids won’t increase SV by 10%, reducing potential benefit.
Fluid challenges help treat volume depletion without causing overload.
Fluid challenge volume varies in literature but should be administered within 10 minutes to observe response (Miller et al., 2015).

To summarize, perioperative fluid management is never a one size fits all approach. It should be individualized, carefully factoring in the type of surgery, preoperative volume status, patient’s risk factors while aiming to maintain euvolemia throughout the perioperative period to enhance recovery and decreased complications rate related to hypo or hypervolemia. Figure 1. from Miller and Myles (2019) review article summarizes the approach of moderately liberal approach with the utilization of GDT in high-risk cases.

### Response 3 (Mary Johnsy Joseph)

Hi Tenzing,

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;It is very informative and you explained in detail about the perioperative fluid management as it plays a critical role in maintaining hemodynamic stability. As you explained, goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT) highlights how tailored fluid administration can improve surgical outcomes, reduce complications, and ensure faster recovery for patients undergoing major surgeries. Monnet et al. (2015) described that Ultrasound-guided monitoring (e.g., for fluid responsiveness using echocardiography) or arterial pressure-based methods like Pulse Pressure Variation (PPV) are increasingly used for real-time feedback to guide fluid administration. It allows real-time visualization of cardiac function and fluid status, helping clinicians decide when and how much fluid to administer. By assessing changes in stroke volume or cardiac output in real-time, clinicians can titrate fluid administration, preventing both tissue hypoperfusion) and over-resuscitation which can cause pulmonary edema or cardiac complications.

&#160; &#160; &#160;Awesome explanation about individualised goal directed therapy and explanation in details. I found it interesting that recent evidence supports the use of crystalloids as the preferred fluid choice for most perioperative fluid management due to their lower cost, better safety profile, and similar effectiveness compared to colloids in a variety of surgical settings. In contrast, crystalloids, which include solutions like saline, Ringer’s lactate, and Plasma-Lyte, have a safer overall profile with fewer complications, particularly in the general surgical population as it prevents complications such as hypovolemia or shock (Mauermann &amp; Kwiatkowski, 2015).

### Response 4 (Adrian Harris)

Hi Tenzing and Mary,

&#160;

Thanks for your great information about the current data around perioperative fluid management. The unique fluid requirements of each patient shown by their hemodynamic responsiveness to fluids are sometimes quite evident, especially when fluid administration is adjusted quickly either to run a bolus or to slow down its’ maintenance infusion rates.

&#160;

What’s interesting to note, is that for patients without an indwelling foley catheter in-situ intraoperatively, there can also be a hemodynamic response to fluid administration when it has exceeded the patient’s replacement needs from loss of fluid or blood loss.&#160;

&#160;

Intraoperative hypertension can be a resultant of a distended bladder, and a patient may respond with this hypertension that mimics that of a physiological response to pain (1). This can be even more pronounced during neuraxial anesthesia at the lumbar or sacral level, which blocks the parasympathetic and sympathetic regulation of bladder function (1). This absence of bladder control will result in urinary retention until the neuraxial block wears off. &#160;The anesthesia provider should be cognisant of the amount of fluid provided to the patient as so not to increase the risk of bladder overdistention and induce a physiological response in the patient that resembles pain (1).

&#160;

As Tenzing wonderfully explained above, GDT’s targeted-fluid response to patients supports improved post-operative outcomes. In the recovery period, if a tailored approach was utilized especially in neuraxial cases, this can be even more evident if care has not been taken to avoid the over- administration of fluids (1).&#160; Post-operative urinary retention occurs in about one-third of all patients who have received neuraxial anesthesia (2).&#160; These patients may require additional steps, such as the use of ultrasonography to identify bladder overdistension in the recovery phase, as so to avoid post-operative discomfort, agitation or pain (3). &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

### Response 5 (Meera Sathananthan)

Hi all!

Thank you for the lovely discussion on perioperative fluid administration! It&#39;s been a pleasure reading everyone&#39;s insights on titrating fluids effectively.

Adrian, I have also noticed several clinicians using goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT) when approaching fluid management. As Tenzing highlighted, knowing when and how to administer fluids appropriately is crucial, especially with the tools at our disposal.

Mary mentioned using echocardiography and arterial lines to measure CO and I wanted to explore a few other adjuncts that can also support GDT:

Esophageal Doppler Monitoring (EDM) - a valuable, minimally invasive technique for continuously monitoring cardiac output (CO). The thin, flexible probe, resembling an oro- or nasogastric tube, generates a flow-time tracing by analyzing ultrasound waves reflected by red blood cells (RBCs). With this tool, we can accurately titrate fluid administration and evaluate the impact of fluid boluses in real-time, offering a responsive and nuanced approach to fluid management (1).

Electrical Bioimpedance - non-invasive alternative for assessing CO. It’s particularly useful in facilities with limited invasive monitoring resources. This technique uses a low-amplitude, high-frequency current detected through four electrocardiography (ECG) electrodes on one side of the patient’s body. Changes in current due to blood flow help measure CO accurately, comparable to thermodilution methods. However, it’s contraindicated for patients with pacemakers due to the use of current, so it requires selective use (1).

FloTrac System -&#160;using an indwelling arterial catheter, FloTrac provides real-time hemodynamic metrics derived from arterial pressure waveforms, including SPV, SVV and PPV, and even calculates CO. This system is particularly beneficial for high-risk cases where we need continuous, real-time data to guide fluid and hemodynamic management effectively, but can be used in any case utilizing an arterial line to optimize care (2).

Each of these methods provides unique insights, allowing us to tailor fluid administration even more precisely and improve postoperative outcomes. It will be interesting to see which, if any, of these methods institutions utilize when doing our placements. I know at my institution, we have the FloTrac but I am unfamiliar with how often it is implemented.&#160;

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, everyone, for your input to this rich discussion!

Tenzing also provided a great introduction to goal-directed fluid therapy (GDFT). This topic will be further discussed next semester. More and more anesthesia departments are considering the use of GDFT. &#160;It is an approach that is individualized to every patient and is based on real-time measurements such as SVV stroke volume variation (SVV) or pulse pressure variation (PPV). However, there are still many variabilities in the literature regarding GDFT. The definition of GDFT varies amongst different studies. Some studies only used fluid administration, while others used fluids and vasoactive drugs. There are also inconsistencies in the triggers for fluid bolus administration, bolus volumes, and types of fluid administered. &#160;

The field of anesthesia is constantly evolving due to ongoing evidence-based research. Fluid management is a prime example of this dynamic change. As Anesthesia Assistants, we should always stay informed about the latest guidelines and practices.

# Question 20

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3276/View)

## Question

Question 20: Describe the process of autologous blood transfusion using pre-donation and intra-operative recovery methods such as “cell-saver.”
### Response 1 (Minna Jin)

Autologous blood transfusion using pre-donation, also known as pre-operative autologous donation (PAD), refers to donation of one’s own blood in preparation for elective surgeries with a high risk of blood loss such as total hip replacement, total knee replacement and hysterectomy, which may require transfusion (Canadian Blood Services, 2021). The process of PAD involves the following steps:

&#160;

Evaluation of patient eligibility for PAD:

In 2018, National Advisory Committee on Blood and Blood Products (NAC) recommended restricting PAD to patients with rare blood group antibodies or rare blood phenotype.
Patient age: 17-71 years old
Minimum autologous donor weight: 50kg (110 lbs)
For first donation, minimum hemoglobin: 110g/L; minimum hematocrit: 33%
For subsequent donations, minimum hemoglobin: 105g/L; minimum hematocrit: 32%
Blood pressure

Systolic maximum: 180, minimum 90
Diastolic maximum: 100, minimum 50

No history of severe cardiac disease
No history of epilepsy or adult convulsions

(Canadian Blood Services, 2021; Transfusion Ontario, 2015)&#160;

Timing of donation:&#160;

If PAD is recommended, the physician can obtain an autologous package and coordinate with Canadian Blood Service (CBS) 4-6 weeks in advance of surgery date
Autologous donors can donate 1 unit of blood per week, up to a maximum of 4 donations&#160;
No pre-donation within 72 hours of the surgery
Iron therapy can help with the recovery of hemoglobin level in between each donation

(Canadian Blood Services, 2021; Transfusion Ontario, 2015)

Upon receiving autologous donated blood products:

Each whole blood unit is labelled with CBS group number and an autologous tag, which includes patient specific and surgical information
Whole blood is processed into red blood cell units; plasma is available only upon special request before donation, and autologous whole blood is not available
Each autologous unit is screened for transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), including Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B, hepatitis C, Human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and syphilis.&#160;

Units confirmed positive for infections (except syphilis) are destroyed, and donors are disqualified from future donations
Units positive for syphilis can still be used for autologous transfusion, but are labelled with a biohazard label
Donors with a history of hepatitis B who tested negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) can donate with medical approval, with their units labeled as biohazardous.
Units with false-positive or indeterminate TTI results are considered acceptable for use

(Canadian Blood Services, 2021; Transfusion Ontario, 2015)

Storage and usage:&#160;

Once tested, autologous units are sent to hospital for storage in a refrigerator at 1-6, kept separate from the allogenic inventory.&#160;
These units are accompanied by an autologous tag with patient information and another section of the tag is provided to the patient.&#160;
Upon admission, patient information is verified against the stored autologous units using the autologous tag, and additional ABO and Rh testing on both the patient and stored units is conducted to confirm a match.&#160;
During surgery, if transfusion is needed, autologous units are issued through the standard process by hospital blood bank, with all units transfused on or after the surgery date. Any unused autologous units will be discarded by the hospital, with the CBS notified of their final disposition.&#160;

(Transfusion Ontario, 2015)

&#160;

Intraoperative cell salvage (ICS) is a method that collects, processes, and returns the patient’s own shed red blood cells during or right after surgery, providing a safe autologous transfusion option (Carroll &amp; Young, 2021). This method involves the usage of a cell saver machine, which is set up before surgery in the operating room. During the procedure, all the blood lost is collected by the cell saver via a specialized suction system with a pressure of -100 to -150 mmHg, minimizing red blood cell damage (Carroll &amp; Young, 2021). High-speed centrifugation separates red blood cells from plasma and cellular debris, and these cells are then washed in normal saline, creating a high-hematocrit suspension of packed red cells ready for transfusion back to the patient (Carroll &amp; Young, 2021). Waste products, including plasma proteins, clotting factors, white cells, bone fragments, bacteria, and other contaminants, are discarded. The cell saver can return up to 80% of the red blood cells lost during surgery (Carroll &amp; Young, 2021). However, cell saver is contraindicated in cancer patients due to concerns about contamination of the reinfused blood with tumor cells (Carroll &amp; Young, 2021).

&#160;

The usage of PAD and ICS reduces the need for donor blood transfusions, thereby lowering risk of transfusion reactions, preventing alloimmunization and eliminating transfusion-transmitted infections. The choice between PAD and ICS depends on factors such as patient’s current health status, past medical history, anticipated blood loss, and the type and urgency of surgery. ICS is beneficial in emergency situations with unexpected significant blood loss, while PAD is suitable for planned elective surgeries with anticipated high blood loss.&#160;

### Response 2 (Deena Kurilsky)

Thank you for the comprehensive information on pre-operative autologous donation and intraoperative cell salvage! I’m curious, in your experience, what types of common surgical patients have you seen intraoperative cell salvage used on?

&#160;

At Mount Sinai hospital we have a considerable number of cancer patients in the operating room, which helps to explain why the cell saver is rarely used.&#160;

&#160;

The patients we do see it used most with are our high-risk mothers with placenta percreta and increta. Given the high risk of bleeding with these patients during delivery we often have a perfusionist from Toronto General come to operate the cell saver.

### Response 3 (Minna Jin)

Hi Deena, thank you for sharing your experience with cell saver.&#160;

&#160;

As an ICU nurse at Toronto General Hospital, I often receive post-transplant patients with reports indicating the amount of blood they received from a cell saver during surgery. At UHN, cell savers are commonly prepared for emergency procedures, such as vascular bleeds. They are also recommended for major orthopedic and spine surgeries, cardiac surgery, trauma surgery, and hepatic resection.

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Excellent overview, Minna! &#160;

I also had a personal experience in utilizing autologous transfusion in a Jehovah’s Witness patient many years ago. This patient considered anything that had left his body foreign and would not allow it to be returned to him. PAD was out of the picture because even his own blood collected before the surgery was still considered a foreign material. We ended up using acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) with intriguing webs of intravenous tubing to keep the collection blood bag “connected” to the patient.&#160;

Just a special note for patients with special religious beliefs, the decision needs to be made on an individual basis. This can also be taken literally as asking Jehovah’s Witness patients individually (alone). &#160;We have had cases where we received different answers when the patient was alone and when the patient was with his religious elders and family.

PAD was promoted back in the early 1980s as a response to viral transmission by allogeneic blood. However, nowadays, with a dramatic reduction in transfusion-transmitted viral infections, I have rarely seen any PAD. &#160;First of all, as Minna mentioned, the patient requires a special referral and needs to go to the Canadian Blood Services Autologous Blood Donor Clinic to pre-donate blood. &#160;Besides the potential of causing perioperative anemia, there is a high discard rate. 60-80% of the collected units are eventually discarded, causing a waste of patient’s blood, time, and healthcare resources. Therefore, the Canadian Blood Services is no longer recommending PAD except for patients with rare blood groups or multiple blood group antibodies where compatible allogeneic blood is difficult to obtain. &#160;Does anyone have any experience with PAD?

Thanks, Minna and Deena, for sharing your experience with cell saver. At UHN, we provide cell salvage upon special request from the surgeon or anesthesiologist. &#160;We have perfusionists and a pool of cell-salvage-trained RRT/AA who can perform cell salvage collection in the operating room. &#160;Does anyone else have any personal experience in running a cell saver?&#160;

# Question 21

## Question

Question 21: What are the manifestations of hemolytic transfusion reaction in a patient receiving general anesthesia? What is the appropriate initial management?
### Response 1 (Ryan Christopher Floro)

Transfusions, whether it be packed red blood cells, platelets, plasma etc, can cause adverse reactions ranging from minor to life-threatening (Suddock &amp; Crookston, 2023). Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTR) are a type of transfusion reaction characterized by hemolysis of red blood cells either through immune or non-immune methods (Suddock &amp; Crookston, 2023). Immune HTRs are caused primarily by incompatibility of the donor blood while non-immune HTRs are due to thermal or osmotic damage to donor blood which then reacts with the patient’s blood (Rout et al., 2023).

&#160;

Symptoms of HTRs are often masked during surgery because of general anesthesia (Nuttall et al., 2006; Shimabukuro &amp; Miller, 2023). Hypotension, tachycardia, hemoglobinuria, microvascular bleeding, and acute renal failure are key indicators of HTRs during anesthesia, though they can be confused as signs of other issues (Nuttall et al., 2006; Shimabukuro &amp; Miller, 2023). Uncontrolled bleeding and disseminated intravascular coagulation are additional signs of HTR (Apfelbaum et al., 2015).

&#160;

Management of HTR involves immediate cessation of blood transfusion and returning to blood bank for testing (Rout et al., 2023), blood pressure management, and aggressive transfusion of other blood products to combat coagulopathy and ensure oxygen delivery – platelets, plasma, cryoprecipitate (Apfelbaum et al., 2015). Urine output should also be maintained using crystalloids and administration of furosemide (Shimabukuro &amp; Miller, 2023).

### Response 2 (Mary Johnsy Joseph)

Hi Ryan,&#160;

&#160; &#160;You explained the topic in detail and covered all important points about the topic. Thank you for sharing it. In a patient receiving general anesthesia, the symptoms of hemolytic reaction may be masked or harder to detect initially, but can still occur during or after the transfusion.

&#160; &#160;Popovsky &amp; Abraham (2018) described in detail the symptoms of hemolytic transfusion reaction as follows:&#160;

Unexpected hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation or anesthesia levels may raise suspicion for a hemolytic transfusion reaction, especially if there is no other clear cause.&#160;
Hemolytic reactions can cause fever due to the immune response and the release of pyrogens from the lysed red blood cells.
One of the hallmark signs of hemolysis is hemoglobinuria, where free hemoglobin from lysed red blood cells is excreted in the urine, causing it to appear dark brown or reddish.

&#160; &#160;Delayed hemolysis (occurring hours to days after the transfusion) may present with jaundice or anemia as the immune system slowly eliminates transfused cells. &#160;As you explained, appropriate management of hemolytic transfusion reaction is to stop the transfusion, maintain IV access and administer saline. Furthermore, it is important to continue to monitor urine output, vital signs, and laboratory parameters (e.g., creatinine, LDH, bilirubin, haptoglobin) for several hours to days after the reaction to monitor for delayed hemolysis or renal complications.&#160;

### Response 3 (Junia Isaac)

Hi Ryan and Mary,

&#160;

Your explanations of hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) under general anesthesia are comprehensive, especially regarding the difficulty of identifying symptoms due to anesthesia&#39;s masking effects. I’d like to build on the conversation by adding that acute HTRs can also cause an inflammatory response that manifests through cytokine release, leading to symptoms like hypothermia or unexplained cardiovascular instability – critical signs to watch for during surgery (Napolitano et al., 2009).

&#160;

A potential complication to consider is hyperkalemia from lysed red blood cells, which can be challenging to manage intraoperatively. Given this risk, are there specific strategies at your institutions to minimize hemolysis during transfusion, such as temperature control, filtration methods, or storage practices? It would be interesting to hear if there are protocols in place that address hemolysis prevention to reduce complications like hyperkalemia and other transfusion-related reactions.

&#160;

I also appreciated the discussion on managing HTRs by stopping the transfusion and supporting renal function. Another aspect worth exploring is the role of early hemofiltration in preventing renal failure if hemoglobinuria persists. Have any of you encountered cases where this approach was implemented? If so, did it have a noticeable impact on outcomes?

&#160;

Lastly, since rapid detection is critical, do you think there’s value in using point-of-care diagnostic tools to quickly identify hemolysis markers during surgery? Tools like haptoglobin or LDH measurements may aid in earlier diagnosis when symptoms are ambiguous.

&#160;

Thank you for this insightful discussion!

&#160;

### Response 4 (Kurt Protacio)

Hey Ryan,

&#160;

Great job summarizing this interesting topic! I liked how Mary and Junia added another layer on top of what you had already summarized beautifully. It will help us become better clinicians in the future.

&#160;

In my research of this topic, I was able to find that during 1978-1985, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accounted for 158 acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (HTRs) related deaths in the United States, with most fatalities having been associated with transfusions of 200mL or more (Vamvakas &amp; Blajchman, 2009). As everyone has already commented, stopping the infusion and supporting renal function by inducing diuresis intraoperatively and postoperatively can be the difference in patient recovery. Management of sepsis and hemolysis are also important steps to treating the effects of HTR. Additionally, Panch et al. (2019) has provided a list of recommended intravenous (IV) fluids and medications for patients having HTR:

Isotonic Saline to maintain urine output at a rate above 0.5 to 1 ml/kg/hr
Diuretics (initial 40mg intravenous (IV) bolus of Furosemide, followed by a continuous infusion of 10 to 40mg/hr in the absence of hypotension
Sodium bicarbonate IV at an initial rate of 200ml/hr to achieve urinary pH &gt;6.5. Stop infusion if arterial blood gas pH is &gt;7.5 or if urinary pH fails to increase after 2 hours

&#160;

From a general anesthesia perspective, researchers found that the administration of volatile gases such as Isoflurane can exacerbate the oxidative stress on red blood cells (RBCs), potentially increasing lysis during transfusions. One study found that Isoflurane’s molecular structure involving both chlorine and fluorine ions play a key role in its hemolytic activity, especially at more concentrated doses, whereas Desflurane and Sevoflurane had very little correlation to hemolytic activity (Gonz&#225;lez-Moral et al., 2022). In light of this, using the right anesthetic gas can potentially impact the use of transfusions during surgery should the need arise.

### Response 5 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Hi Junia,

I believe you meant hyperthermia. Cytokines, part of the body’s immune response, can trigger the hypothalamus to increase body temperature. This response is common in infections and inflammatory conditions.

:::
### Response 6 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Stimulating discussion on hemolytic transfusion reaction!

Although most often, hemolysis of red blood cells (RBCs) is due to ABO incompatibility, Ryan pointed out that there are also non-immune causes. I want to explore Junia’s idea of minimizing hemolysis during transfusion. First of all, we should avoid transfusing blood using small gauge needles and small veins. We should use blood tubing with a filter with a pore size of 170 to 200 microns to remove small clots and cellular debris, which can cause hemolysis. Because of the increased viscosity of packed RBCs, we should dilute with normal saline to decrease hemolysis and ensure smooth blood flow. We should never infuse blood products with glucose-containing solutions because these solutions can cause RBC hemolysis. We should also avoid Ringer’s Lactate because it contains calcium and may induce clot formation.&#160;

Regarding temperature control, we should use a blood warming device to avoid hypothermia, but the warmer should not be set to higher than&#160;43oC to prevent hemolysis. Blood products should be stored at the appropriate temperature (usually between 1-6oC) to maintain their integrity. Preservatives are often added to extend the shelf life and minimize hemolysis.

## Question

Question 22: Other than hemolytic transfusion reaction, describe other potential complications of blood product administration.
### Response 1 (Kelly Gram)

Blood Transfusions save countless lives every year but are not without risk. Although blood transfusion safety has improved significantly over the years with more diligent donor screening and more involved blood testing methods which have dramatically reduced adverse events, there continues to be considerable risk involved. The complications can be divided into two categories – infectious and non-infectious. Infectious complications are rare in developed countries, but are very serious with considerable morbidity and mortality associated with it. Non-infectious complications happen with higher frequency and can be life-threatening(1,2).

**Non-infectious Adverse Events**

Non infectious complications can be further divided into acute (&lt;24 hours) and delayed (&gt;24 hours) reactions. Acute reactions are comprised of immune mediated reactions as well as a non-immune mediated reactions(2).

**Acute**

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; **Immune Mediated reactions**

Acute Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (AHTR) – will not be discussed in this overview
Febrile Non-Hemolytic Transfusion Reaction (FNHTR)

Occurs 2.4/1000 transfusions in Canada (one of the most common transfusion reactions)(3).
14 times more likely to occur with platelet transfusion than with packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion and very uncommon with plasma.
Defined as fever &gt; 38C and +1C above baseline, chills, rigors and pain within 4 hours of transfusion(2,3).
Not well understood but thought to be related to cytokine release from donor leukocytes during storage. Another proposed mechanism is recipience antibodies attacking donor leukocytes, especially in those sensitized by prior transfusions or pregnancy.
Diagnosed by exclusion - must exclude AHTR, infectious causes, TRALI or other causes of fever(2)
Transfusion should be stopped immediately and blood work drawn, acetaminophen or demorol for symptom management(2,3).
Leukoreduction, a process that removes leukocytes from whole blood, has proven effective at reducing the risk of forming antibodies to blood products and minimizing risk of FNHTR(4).

Allergic

Occurs in 1-3% of transfusions.
Can present on a continuum from mild skin presentations to anaphylaxis (rare at 1 in 20,000) including hives, pruritis, edema, angioedema up to and including bronchospasm and hypotension.
Results from recipient reaction to soluble plasma proteins (such as Immunoglobulin A (IgA)), particularly when the recipient has had prior exposure or sensitization to these antigens.
Transfusion should be stopped as soon as symptoms begin and symptom management with diphenhydramine for mild skin eruptions, up to and including epinephrine, oxygen and IV fluids for anaphylactoid reactions.
Leukoreduction does not reduce risks of allergic reactions(2,3).

Anaphylactic

Incidence is 1 in 50,000 RBC transfusions(3).
Criteria for Diagnosis – onset of an illness + either hypotension or difficulty breathing
More common in IgA deficient individuals who have anti-IgA antibodies.
If a patient has a history of anaphylactic reaction to blood products and requires blood products, a process called cell-washing can be done to purify the blood product and remove excess proteins and cellular debris, reducing the risk of anaphylaxis.
Blood collected from IgA deficient individuals is also labeled and available to be given to high risk patients(2).
The drawback to blood products undergoing cell-washing is the reduced amount of blood product post washing. 10-20% of a unit of PRBC is lost and up to 33% of platelets are lost during cell-washing, therefore, cell-washing has not become standard practice due to impracticality(5).

Transfusion Related Acute Lung Injury (TRALI)

Occurs in 1.2 in every 100,000 transfusions and is one of the leading causes of mortality among all transfusion related complications.
Incidence correlates with volume of plasma transfused and is 50-100 times more common in critically ill or surgical patients than in the general population.
Characterized by non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and respiratory failure.
Symptoms occur within 6 hours of transfusion and include: dyspnea, hypoxia (SpO2&lt;90% on room air), tachypnea, low-grade fever, rigors, tachycardia, hypotension, hypothermia and new onset bilateral infiltrates on chest imaging.
Causes are thought to be related to pro-inflammatory mediator release from the stored blood products, or antibodies from donor blood attacking antigens in recipients blood. It is thought critically ill patients are predisposed to TRALI due to their already precarious state, making an inflammatory response more detrimental to their health.
Management is to stop transfusion immediately, perform chest imaging, aggressive respiratory support, poor evidence for the use of steroids or diuretics, supportive care(2,3).

**Non-immune Mediated reactions**

Air embolism
Transfusion associated circulatory overload (TACO)

Occurs in 9.1/100,000 transfusions. One of the leading causes of mortality among transfusion related complications
Significantly higher incidence in those with poor cardiac function and other underlying medical conditions, as well we amount of blood products transfused and rate of infusion.
Characterized by acute onset of shortness of breath and other evidence of fluid overload such as hypertension, elevated BNP, hypoxemia and tachycardia. Chest imaging shows pulmonary edema with or without pleural effusions.
Management includes identifying patients at risk for TACO and mitigating risk by giving transfusions slowly, avoiding unnecessary blood products or fluids.
Treatment once identified is diuretics and supportive care such as oxygen.
TACO and TRALI share many symptoms and can be difficult to differentiate. Response to diuretics typically favour TACO(2,3).

Non-immune mediated hemolysis

Very rare and generally benign complication of transfusion.
Breakdown of RBCs due to a number of external or mechanical factors such as improper storage (ie. too high or low of temperature), transfusing under pressure via a small bore needle, using rapid pressure infuser, transfusing with isotonic solutions.
In most instances, symptoms are mild fever and tachycardia, but in rare circumstances, may result in hemoglobinurea or hemoglobinemia(2,3,6).

**&#160;**

**Delayed**

Transfusion associated Graft vs. Host Disease (TAGvHD)

Incidence is 0.01 per 100,000 transfusions but mortality exceeds 90%
Occurs 1-6 weeks post transplant and only in response to transfusion of PRBC’s, platelets of granulocytes.
Viable donor T-lymphocytes present in cellular blood products engraft and attack recipient tissues and organs resulting in an immune response.
Risk factors include immunodeficiency or transfusion in a population with high degree of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) similarity (rendering the recipeints immune system unable to remove donor t-cells due to partial HLA matching).
Characterized by rashes, transaminitis, fever, gastrointestinal symptoms and/or pancytopenia
&#160;Management aims to blunt the immune response with steroids and cytotoxic agents. The only curative option is a bone marrow transplant but not often feasible due to the acute progression of TAGvHD
Prevention includes irradiation of blood products as well as avoiding haploidentical blood products from close relatives(2,3).

Delayed Bradykinin hypotension

Stored blood, particularly leukoreduced blood, contains an excess of bradykinin which when allowed to circulate without being broken down, causes vasodilation and hypotension.
Recipients (or donors) taking Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are more at risk for hypotension as ACE breaks down bradykinin(2,3,7).

Post transfusion Purpura (PTP)

Occurs 1 in 25,000 transfused units of platelets within two weeks and is associated with a 10-20% mortality rate.
Causes alloantibodies to be formed to human platelet antigens (HPA) which cause the destruction of not only the transfused platelets, but the bodies own platelets as well.
Characterized by wet blood filled blisters (purpura) and thrombocytopenia
Treated with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG)(2,3).

**Infectious Adverse Events**

Bacterial Transfusion Transmitted Infections (BTTI)

Bacterial transmission has significantly declined over the past 25 years due to much more stringent donor screening, exclusion and blood testing with 1 in 3000 in platelet and 1 in 30,000 in RBC transfusions. Despite this reduction, bacterial transmission still accounts for 10% of transfusion related deaths.
The bacterial contamination in platelets is much higher because they are stored at room temperature and not refrigerated or frozen like other blood products. As a result, platelets can only be safely stored for 5 days, and attempts to prolong that window yielded too much bacterial growth.
Contaminated PRBC appear much darker red due to bacterial oxygen consumption and contaminated platelets appear to have swirls in it indicating its not safe to administer.
Symptoms include fever (&gt;2 degrees above baseline), rigor, chills, tachycardia, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting.
Treatment includes stopping transfusion immediately &amp; sending it for testing if bacterial contamination is suspected, supportive care including blood pressure and respiratory support if required, empiric broad spectrum antibiotics and septic blood workup(1).

Non-Bacterial Transfusion Transmitted Infections (TTI)

Early transfusions which caused the spread of syphilis followed by hepatitis brought significant awareness to transfusion related transmission of blood-borne infections.
Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) along with rigorous donor screening has significantly reduced the risk of TTI.
Testing is so sensitive for known virus’ that the only real risk exists in the window period which is the time between exposure and when the lab tests can detect the virus. This risk is further mitigated with specific and comprehensive donor questionnaires.
Looking at epidemiology of viruses in certain geographical locations, viruses like cytomegalovirus (CMV), human T-Lymphotropic virus (HTLV) and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease can be nearly eliminated by leukodepletion practices(1).

### Response 2 (Teresa Nguyen)

Hi Kelly&#160;

Thanks for the highly descriptive answer. You’ve included excellent points under each type of reaction. In regards to your explanation on Transfusion Associated Circulatory Overload (TACO), you have mentioned that management includes identifying patients who are at risk for TACO and mitigating that risk by administering transfusions at a slower rate.&#160;

I would like to share that risk factors for TACO include:&#160;

Patients who are newborns

Patients who are elderly&#160;

Individuals with pre-existing cardiac dysfunction&#160;

Renal dysfunction&#160;

Myocardial infarction&#160;

Patients receiving plasma&#160;

(Alam et al., 2013)&#160;

You mentioned that cell-washing can be done for patients with a history of anaphylaxis to blood products. My inquiry question for you is, can cell washing also be used for patients with allergic reactions? You have mentioned that allergies can present on a continuum from mild skin presentation to anaphylaxis. Additionally, is it possible to do varying degrees of cell washing in order to preserve more PRBCs and/or platelets?&#160;

### Response 3 (Ryan Smith)

Thank you Kelly and Teresa for your comprehensive look at the potential complications of transfusing blood.&#160;&#160;

In the very co-morbid ICU population whom is already on vasopressive support, moderate to high ventilatory settings and frequent bloodwork draws it can be profoundly difficult to differentiate TACO from TRALI.&#160; Indeed I have personally witnessed hundreds of bedside rounds/urgent rounds attendance discussions trying to elucidate why a patient has decompensated quickly after a transfusion.&#160; 15+ years ago all ICU patients would get morning chest radiographs, and thus we had a basis to compare (at least radiologically) what was presumed to be TRALI and TACO reaction vs several hours earlier when the daily CXR was taken.&#160; As we have obviously moved away from that practice a recent anecdote paper suggests the following for mitigating the risks for TRALI and TACO:

Treatment of TACO and TRALI is largely supportive but intubation with pharmacologic pressure support may be required.
The incidence of TRALI can be reduced with increased donor screening. The incidence of TACO can be reduced with increased recipient screening. (1)

Serial chest radiographs are highly beneficial to elucidating what acute pathology is occurring.&#160;

In the context of peri-operative care and the PACU setting, having a clinician that has observed the central venous pressure, arterial line waveforms, bloodwork if taken,&#160; ventilation and oxygenation, and knows the fluid ins/outs is just as valuable as imaging to diagnose TRALI/TACO.

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, Kelly, for a comprehensive discussion on the different transfusion reactions! For anything we give to our patients, we must be aware of the signs and symptoms of the complications and which patient populations post higher risk.&#160;

I want to add hemolytic disease of the newborn/fetus to the list of immune-mediated reactions. This can happen in fetomaternal transfusion, when a Rh-negative mother is pregnant with a Rh-positive fetus. This can lead to the mother forming anti-D (Rh) antibodies, which can then transfer to the fetus, causing the hemolytic reaction. This is more likely to occur in a second Rh-incompatible pregnancy when the mother has already formed the Rh antibodies. To prevent this reaction, the mother can be given Rh immunoprophylaxis with Rh immunoglobulin shots to prevent the mother’s body from producing any potentially dangerous Rh antibodies. I learned that anesthesia assistants at Mount Sinai Hospital perform the anesthesia for intra-uterine blood transfusions for fetal anemia as a result of Rh-incompatible pregnancy. An ultrasound-guided needle is inserted through the maternal abdomen into the umbilical cord to initiate the transfusion. The fetus is typically paralyzed before the transfusion with Rocuronium to prevent movement for the procedure and reduce the risk of complications.

Another potential complication is metabolic abnormalities. Following a massive blood transfusion, there may be a risk of developing metabolic acidosis. This is because the preservatives in blood products may increase hydrogen ions, causing metabolic acidosis. On the other hand, the citrate present in the preservative as an anticoagulant may cause metabolic alkalosis and hypocalcemia. &#160;

Also, don’t forget about the risk of hypothermia. This is so easily prevented though. No matter how urgent the situation, we need to deliver blood through a blood warmer (except for platelets) because hypothermia can cause cardiac irritability and increase oxygen consumption, which may lead to myocardium ischemia.

## Question

Question 3: Describe the potential complications of excessive fluid administration.
### Response 1 (Junia Isaac)

Excessive fluid administration, while often integral in stabilizing critically ill or surgical patients, can result in complex, multi-system complications that prolong recovery and increase morbidity. In the perioperative setting, excessive fluids impose a direct burden on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, where increased cardiac preload and hydrostatic pressures contribute to fluid buildup in the lungs, resulting in pulmonary edema. Perioperative fluid overload leads to respiratory distress and reduces oxygenation efficiency, complicating recovery for patients undergoing major surgeries (Messina et al., 2020). Similarly, Clark, Huespe, and Martin (2020) focus on the intensive care setting, detailing that fluid overload exacerbates pulmonary capillary pressures, which can compromise oxygen exchange and increase the need for ventilatory support. They underscore that in critical care, managing fluid status is essential to preventing pulmonary complications that further burden compromised patients.

&#160;

In terms of cardiac impact, fluid overload increases cardiac preload, which can overwhelm the heart’s pumping capacity and result in congestive heart failure (CHF) if not managed appropriately (Clark et al., 2020). In the OR, elevated preload increases myocardial workload, potentially leading to inadequate cardiac output and tissue perfusion, especially in patients with pre-existing cardiac compromise. This hemodynamic strain is especially concerning during anesthesia, as anesthetic drugs can further reduce cardiac output, compounding fluid overload risks. Additionally, excessive fluid creates systemic volume expansion that disrupts capillary pressure gradients, leading to central and peripheral venous congestion and further exacerbating pulmonary edema.

&#160;

The renal system is also vulnerable to fluid overload, where hypervolemia frequently leads to acute kidney injury (AKI) through mechanisms like renal congestion and electrolyte imbalances. Kaplan and Kellum (2009) discuss how excessive fluid administration increases renal venous pressure, impairing glomerular filtration, reducing urine output, and escalating fluid retention in a cycle that worsens kidney function. This is especially concerning in anesthesia practice, as AKI complicates perioperative management and increases long-term renal dysfunction. Moreover, excessive fluids disrupt electrolyte balance, leading to conditions like hyponatremia, which can impair nerve and muscle function and complicate anesthetic management. This is particularly concerning in patients already susceptible to renal dysfunction, as fluid overload in such cases exacerbates the severity of renal impairment and complicates overall fluid management, often leading to further interventions such as dialysis.

&#160;

Moreover, studies in veterinary science reinforce these findings, demonstrating that hypervolemia universally triggers edema, impacting organ function similarly across species. Their review highlights how fluid overload, even with minor excesses, contributes to systemic edema, including peripheral and visceral organ congestion, which aligns with human clinical outcomes and suggests that fluid balance is critical across all forms of critical care. This universal physiological response underscores the necessity for precision in fluid administration to avoid overstretching organ capacity.

&#160;

Postoperatively, fluid overload not only affects organ function but also has direct implications on wound healing and infection rates. Elhassan and Magill (2020) discuss how excessive fluid administration contributes to delayed tissue healing, elevated infection rates, and increased incidence of wound dehiscence. These complications arise due to tissue edema, which reduces local tissue oxygenation, impedes immune response efficiency, and creates a more favorable environment for bacterial proliferation. For instance, they explain that postoperative fluid balance is closely tied to healing efficiency, with patients receiving excess fluids showing a notably higher rate of complications than those with balanced fluid management.

&#160;

Lastly, the cumulative effects of fluid overload, including pulmonary edema, CHF, and AKI, underscore the importance of precise fluid balance in surgical and anesthesia care. In elective surgical patients, where outcomes are closely monitored, fluid management plays a pivotal role in reducing hospital stay durations and preventing adverse outcomes. Brandstrup et al. (2006) provide evidence that precise fluid therapy reduces postoperative complications and improves overall recovery time. Their study found that patients receiving restrictive fluid therapy had shorter hospitalizations and fewer complications, such as infections and delayed wound healing, underscoring the importance of avoiding fluid overload to optimize postoperative outcomes. Their findings reinforce the need for anesthesia providers to closely monitor and adjust fluid administration, tailoring it to each patient’s unique hemodynamic and metabolic needs. This balance not only prevents fluid-related complications but also enhances the overall safety and efficacy of perioperative management.

&#160;

In summary, the collective evidence from these articles underscores that while fluid therapy is indispensable for maintaining hemodynamic stability, excessive fluid administration creates a multifaceted risk to patients, particularly those with underlying vulnerabilities. A balanced approach to fluid therapy is critical, as it minimizes complications such as pulmonary and systemic edema, renal impairment, and delayed wound healing, supporting improved perioperative outcomes and faster recovery while enhancing patient safety in anesthesia care.

### Response 2 (Laryssa Hartmann)

Hi Junia,

Your thoughtful and detailed overview of fluid management in perioperative and critical care settings is excellent! I agree that fluid administration is essential for patient stabilization, and if not managed properly, it can lead to severe consequences. Striking the right balance between maintaining hemodynamic stability and avoiding fluid overload is crucial. I particularly appreciated the table outlining organ systems and their associated complications; it made a complex topic much easier to understand.

Reading your post prompted me to consider the various strategies for managing fluid administration in the operating room. I’m curious if there are established best practices for how fluids should be administered. One study I came across involved research conducted with 1,000 patients who had acute lung injury (The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network, 2006). This study compared two approaches to fluid management.

Conservative strategy: Involving the administration of less fluid.
Liberal strategy: Involving the administration of more fluid. &#160;

The researchers monitored patients for seven days, assessing various outcomes. The primary goal was to determine how many patients died within 60 days, while secondary goals included the number of days patient spent off ventilators and free from organ failure.

While there was no significant difference in death rate, the conservative fluid management strategy improved lung function and helped patients recover faster without adversely affecting their other organs (The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Clinical Trials Network, 2006). This supports the use of a conservative approach for patients with acute lung injury. Overall, the study suggests that careful fluid management can lead to better outcomes for these patients, and fluid administration should be tailored to each patients specific situation.&#160;

What are your thoughts on restrictive fluid strategies? How do you think they will influence our practices moving forward? &#160;

### Response 3 (Minna Jin)

Hi Junia,

Thank you for your thorough explanation of the impacts of excess fluid administration on pulmonary, cardiac, and renal functions, as well as wound healing. I agree that a balanced fluid approach is important for maintaining hemodynamic stability, while both excessive fluid administration and dehydration can lead to severe health outcomes. In the ICU, we always monitor patients’ 24-hour fluid balance and signs of central and peripheral fluid overload, such as pulmonary edema (crackles) and peripheral edema, as you mentioned. Oftentimes, diuretics such as IV furosemide are ordered to help manage fluid overload. For patients with heart failure, there is typically a fluid restriction of 1.5 liters of fluid intake per 24 hours to minimize the workload on the heart muscles and improve overall cardiac function.

To answer Laryssa’s question regarding restrictive fluid strategies, current studies on various fluid administration strategies indicate that the effectiveness of a restrictive fluid strategy depends on different patient populations.

One study comparing restrictive fluid therapy (RFT) with liberal fluid therapy (LFT) for patients with sepsis-induced hypotension found that RFT did not result in a lower mortality rate compared to LFT (Shapiro et al., 2023).

Another study comparing RFT with LFT for patients undergoing major abdominal surgery showed that RFT was not associated with a higher survival rate than LFT, but it was associated with a higher rate of acute kidney injury (Myles et al., 2018).

A third study comparing goal-directed fluid therapy (GDT) with RFT and LFT in patients undergoing non-vascular abdominal surgery demonstrated that GDT is more effective in reducing perioperative complications, especially wound infections and anastomotic leaks (Yang et al., 2023).

Overall, these findings highlight that there is no single fluid administration therapy that fits all patients; individual patient needs and conditions should be considered to optimize outcomes in various clinical scenarios.&#160;

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Insightful discussion on hypervolemia!&#160;

You have all shared the many adverse effects of hypervolemia. Let me share a case that showcases the consequence of intraoperative hypervolemia. &#160;

One of my colleagues was helping out in a cardiac case. Everything was uneventful until the patient’s systolic pressure suddenly dropped to ~ 60 mmHg when the surgeon was closing his chest. &#160;The pressure quickly rebounded when the surgeon reopened the chest. This happened a couple of times whenever the surgeon would try to close the chest. We discovered that this patient received a significant amount of fluids throughout the surgery. Due to this increased fluid, the patient’s heart would tamponade every time when the surgeon tried to close his chest. In the end, we slowed down his fluids and tried closing the chest 30 minutes later. This time, the patient remained hemodynamically stable. &#160;

This case demonstrated the importance of fluid management and the consequences it brings. It is crucial for us to consider delivering fluids as a kind of therapy instead of just a vehicle to administer drugs. It’s imperative for us to keep a close eye on the running intravenous (IV) and make sure it is slowed down after giving a drug bolus. For very fluid-sensitive patients, sometimes I deliberately put a smaller bag of fluid (250 mL or 500 mL) instead of the usual 1 L bag as a safety measure just in case I inadvertently left the IV fully open. In fluid management, we always need to consider what types of fluid to give, how much to give, when to give, and what rate to give.

### Response 5 (Tenzing Choedar)

Hi Junia,

&#160;

An excellent summary on the complex, multi-system complications associated with circulatory overload due to excessive fluid administration, underscoring the critical importance of precise fluid therapy to mitigate prolonged hospitalization and reduce morbidity. Despite the seemingly straightforward nature of fluid administration, decades of research have yet to yield a definitive approach to perioperative fluid management. Nonetheless, significant strides are continuously being made in advancing optimal practices such as Goal Directed Fluid Therapy (GDT). Much like Phoebe, I wanted to share a personal experience related to fluid administration and flash pulmonary edema (FPE), which I believe will enhance our response and preparedness as Anesthesia Assistants. Understanding the dynamics of flash pulmonary edema is critical, as it elevates our vigilance and readiness to manage this acute, life-threatening event effectively.

&#160;

I had a 70 something year old Asian male patient in arrive in the Cath lab for a diagnostic angiogram after he had on going intermittent chest pain for a few weeks. He was referred by his family doctor after his ECG revealed old infarct pattern in the anterior leads (Q waves from V1 to V4) and transthoracic echocardiogram revealing an ejection fraction of 45% with anterior wall motion abnormality. He was otherwise physically fit and did not have any other reported past medical history. His labs were unremarkable other than a slightly elevated creatinine of 105. I administered the usual midazolam and fentanyl for conscious sedation and angiogram revealed 100% occluded Left Anterior Descending artery. 500ml bolus of fluid was ordered because even though his left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) was slightly on the higher side, 18 mmhg, it was given for renal protection from contrast dye due to his creatinine of 105. We decided to go ahead with angioplasty of the LAD and midway, he had received about 1L of NS in about an hour time for medication administration as well. All of a sudden, he became restless, orthopneic and started desatting quite rapidly in the 80s and I immediately applied 100% oxygen via non-rebreather along with 40mg and his saturation improved mildly to high 80s but was still quite symptomatic. Interventional staff gave intraarterial nitroglycerin bolus to bring his pressure down and procedure was aborted after we ruled out structural causes of FPE via quick POCUS of the heart. RT was paged immediately and CPAP therapy was initiated in the recovery room with a PEEP of about 10cm. Patient ended up recovering well but this highlights the consequence of fluid administration in high-risk patients.

&#160;

In patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) compliance due to his old infarct, even slight increases in LV end-diastolic volume can lead to a significant rise in LV end-diastolic pressure, potentially resulting in pulmonary edema (Rimoldi et al., 2009). In this instance, fluid administration, and I believe coupled with insufficient analgesia for this case, appears to have induced sympathetic overload, pushing an already sensitive left ventricle into flash pulmonary edema (FPE). Evidence robustly supports that an acute rise in sympathetic drive and plasma catecholamine levels can precipitate the onset of FPE (Siddiqua et al., 2023).

&#160;

This highlights not only the critical need to approach fluid administration with the same caution as medication but also highlights the essential role of anesthesia in pain management, especially given that Cath Lab procedures typically proceed without the support of Anesthesia Assistants.

### Response 6 (Paula Watkis)

Hello everyone,

The topic of excess fluid therapy and its potential complications is quite interesting. Another group of patients that receives fluid quite liberally are trauma patients. In a study conducted by Wrzosek, A. et al., 2023, it was noted that the volume of fluid given to trauma patients is an independent risk factor for mortality. Systemmic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), is quite&#160; common in patients with serious trauma. Both colloids and crystalloids do not stay in blood vessels of trauma patients for long, instead they leak into the interstitial space. The hypervolemia places stress on the walls of the atria and in response it reacts by secreting the atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) hormone. The ANP causes rapid shifts of intravascular fluid into the interstitial space as it deteriorates the endothelial glycocalyx. Hence, playing a role in further fluid accumulation and significant tissue edema. (Wrzosek, A. et al., 2023; Chappell, D. et al., 2014).

Excess fluid administration is warranted in patients who are at risk of hypovolemia and resulting end organ hypoperfusion. However, the kind of fluid, the timing and the amount has to be carefully considered. Unnecessary fluid administration should be avoided until the&#160; patient becomes stable. Excess fluid therapy does not only cause complications but worsens some pre existing conditions of multiple vital organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver and kidneys.&#160;

Hi Paula,

Thank you so much for sharing such a detailed and insightful overview of Extracorporeal Life Support (ECLS)/Extracorpeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). It’s truly impressive to see how ECMO technology has advanced and the profound impact it has on patient care, especially in those complex cases requiring both cardiac and respiratory support.

I wanted to build on your fantastic breakdown of ECMO types by drawing on our experience during the height of our collective trauma &#128517;: the COVID-19 pandemic. ECMO played a life-saving role for the most critically ill patients, especially when other advanced therapies had been exhausted. We saw an unprecedented rise in the use of veno-venous (VV) ECMO for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) who were unresponsive to other treatments. We used a wide range of advanced respiratory interventions, including lung-protective ventilation, lung recruitments and PEEP optimizations using recruitment-to-inflation ratio measurements, PEEP titration studies, esophageal balloon catheters, and electrical impedance tomography. We also implemented inhaled nitric oxide, proning, and, in rare cases, high frequency oscillation ventilation (HFOV) - yes, in adult populations! Each patient presented unique challenges, requiring individualized approaches to optimize their oxygenation and ventilation.

In many cases, we had to transfer patients to Toronto General Hospital (TGH) for VV ECMO due to the severity of their conditions. I recall transferring one patient in the tunnel between Mount Sinai Hospital and TGH with 7 other peopl. She was intubated, sedated, paralyzed, on several pressors, and receiving inhaled nitric oxide. We also had extra oxygen tanks due to her 100% FiO2 requirement, making it a challenging transfer given the sheer amount of equipment. She was incredibly hypoxic with a high BMI and was not responding to other treatments. To our shock, she returned a few days later to our ICU from TGH after receiving VV ECMO. Her oxygenation had significantly improved, she was more hemodynamically stable, and her neurological status was remarkably intact. This was a common occurrence with several severely hypoxic COVID ARDS patients we had in 2020 and 2021. Managing hypoxic patients during this period was incredibly challenging due to the severity and unpredictability of their conditions. While not all patients were able to recover, several who seemed to have little chance of survival returned to us alive, successfully weaning off mechanical ventilation and eventually making it back home, all thanks to ECMO as the last line of defense. Witnessing these recoveries—often after a week on ECMO to allow the lungs to rest—was truly inspiring and highlighted the value of ECMO as an advanced life support option when all else fails.

A recent study also highlights the importance of early ECMO intervention, specifically analyzing COVID-19 patients who required ECMO across multiple hospitals (1). Most patients in this study were younger than 55 years, and the study focused on identifying factors linked to survival. Patients who were cannulated early (within four days of ventilation) showed significantly better survival rates, particularly those without pre-existing conditions like ischemic heart disease. Additionally, the use of awake ECMO, where patients are kept awake and not sedated or mechanically ventilated, showed promising outcomes by avoiding complications such as ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Awake ECMO allows patients to maintain spontaneous breathing, reducing the need for positive pressure ventilation, which can contribute to lung injury. This approach also helps lower the risk of infection associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation. These findings emphasize the potential benefits of rapid and well-coordinated ECMO deployment during crises like COVID-19 (1). This is particularly intriguing because it was often used as a last resort rather than an early intervention—though there were significant challenges related to supply limitations and increased demand. It perhaps would be beneficial to further develop this technique to accommodate potential increases in demand in the future.

I really appreciate your clear differentiation between VA and VV ECMO and their respective indications. I’ve included an image that visually compares VV and VA ECMO configurations (Figure 1), as you&#39;ve described:

Figure 1: (a) V-V ECMO with drainage cannula inserted into the right femoral vein and return cannula in the right internal jugular vein. (b) V-A ECMO with the drainage cannula inserted into the right femoral vein, and the return cannula to the left femoral artery (2).

I also wanted to say that your emphasis on keeping the circuit simple to minimize risks like thrombus formation and air embolism is spot on—simplicity often leads to better patient outcomes with fewer complications. Thank you Paula!

### Response 4 (Paula Watkis)

Thank you Meera for sharing your experience. We had similar situations at Sunnybrook during covid, but did not get the same outcomes as some of our candidates were truly not appropriate for ECMO. If I recall correctly, Toronto General Hospital (TGH) was a bit more relaxed in terms of the criteria when accepting patients back in covid. I know for sure that the age requirement has changed, (I am not sure, but will research that information)there is now an age limit and the patient&#39;s neurological status has to be fully ascertained daily by the referring hospital. Sedation interruption is done on each shift to ensure that they are consistently obeying commands and their prognosis is good up to the time of transfer to TGH.

Thank you for the visual comparison between the two. It is very helpful in understanding the configurations of V-A and V-V ECMO as it can become very confusing if you are new to the topic.

&#160;

### Response 5 (Kurt Protacio)

Hi Paula,

Thank you for your contribution in helping us better understand why extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is so important for our vulnerable cardiorespiratory patients. I have had the privilege of working alongside perfusionists and physicians in assisting in cannulating patients on veno-arterial (VA) ECMO. Last week, we had an intubated patient in cardiogenic shock after having a myocardial infarction (MI). The patient arrived from another hospital, and after discussion, the physicians decided to cannulate and proceed with a high-risk percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) soon after. As you mentioned in your note about the impact of VA-ECMO on the heart, specifically the increase in afterload in the left ventricle, the physicians also performed a septostomy, a procedure in which a hole is created in between the left and right atria, in order to decrease the workload of the left ventricle (afterload) (Amancherla et al., 2021). Anesthesia was also a part of the discussion to help provide insight as to which drugs can provide positive hemodynamic changes as the PCI would last approximately 4 hours. A pulmonary artery catheter (PA) was also inserted to help target proper changes in wedge pressure, as well as inserting an arterial line in the right radial artery, which provides more reliable oxygenation values compared to the left side. By analyzing an arterial blood gas (ABG) sample from the right side, it can help detect differences in oxygenation levels between the upper and lower part of the body (Harlequin Syndrome) (Prabhu et al., 2023). We also starting continuous infusions of Dobutamine at a rate of 2.5mcg/kg/min and Sodium Nitroprusside at a rate of 1.5mcg/kg/min to help maintain organ perfusion as the patient&#39;s ejection fraction was less than 20%. Luckily, no vasopressors were needed during the entire case, but we had norepinephrine and phenylephrine ready to go if the mean arterial pressure (MAP) suddenly decreased from the effects in preload or afterload medication (McGrath et al., 2022).

&#160;

In addition, my unit supports the use of an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). It is an invasive device designed to increase myocardial oxygen perfusion and indirectly increases cardiac output and cardiac index through afterload reduction (Figaro et al., 2024). It does this by inflating the balloon during diastole to push oxygenated blood back into the coronaries, resulting in an augmented pressure, greater than the body&#39;s systolic pressure. These features make IABPs a frequently used circulatory support device in patients requiring hemodynamic support either in cardiogenic shock, and/or at risk of hemodynamic decompensation during a high-risk PCI (Kahn &amp; Siddiqui, 2020).

### Response 6 (Tenzing Choedar)

Hi Paula and all those contributing to this discussion,

&#160;

Thank you for providing a great overview of VA and VV ECMO. As someone with a particular interest in mechanical circulatory support, I greatly appreciated your insights on VV ECMO, especially given my own background and more extensive experience with VA ECMO in the Coronary ICU and Cath Lab setting. I work with Kurt and we both have assisted in quite a few urgent peripheral percutaneous VA ECMO insertion in our procedure room in the CICU for cardiogenic shock patients with various etiology, ischemic or non-ischemic (dominant). As Kurt mentioned in his discussion post, I would like to emphasize on the critical importance of implementing an effective Left Ventricle (LV) unloading or venting strategy to reduce the risk of complications associated with VA ECMO support on the heart. Although VA ECMO is capable of providing comprehensive cardiovascular support, it is not without significant risks, particularly in cases of severely impaired LV contractility. As you noted in your post, the retrograde flow from the arterial inflow cannula can increase afterload in an already failing LV. This leads to a decrease in stroke volume and subsequently loss of aortic pulsatility and blood stagnation, which increases the risk of thrombus formation. The rising left ventricular end-diastolic pressure is transmitted to the left atrium, resulting in pulmonary congestion. This backward failure progressively elevates pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) and pulmonary artery diastolic pressure, causing the loss of pulmonary artery pulsatility and exacerbating lung injury (pulmonary edema).

&#160;

**LV unloading** refers to reducing the heart&#39;s mechanical workload to decrease myocardial oxygen consumption (MVO2) and lessen the hemodynamic stresses that can contribute to ventricular remodeling. In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), it helps reduce the size of the infarct by limiting the damage to the heart muscle. It relates more to reducing the pressure volume area (PVA) in the PV loop. In other words, by decreasing the blood volume in the heart, it alleviates the strain on the heart, supporting recovery and preventing further aforementioned complications (Uriel et al., 2018). **LV venting** refers more to decreasing the LV End diastolic **pressure**, which targets to reduce the pulmonary pressures (Jain et al., 2021). You can have low cardiac filling pressures but still need unloading due to increased blood volume in the LV, as noted in the case study by Jain et al. (2021). &#160;

&#160;

Here, I will provide a brief overview of Impella device that I have encountered to help mitigate these risks.

&#160;

Left-sided Impella (Abiomed): Impella is a percutaneous intravascular transaortovalvular microaxial pump device that offers temporary mechanical circulatory support (MCS) to the left ventricle. It is primarily used during high-risk PCI, and in cases of cardiogenic shock post MI, cardiomyopathy, severe myocarditis, or after cardiac surgery. It is positioned across the aortic valve into the left ventricle and delivers continuous antegrade blood flow from the LV into the ascending aorta reducing LV workload, increasing cardiac output, enhancing systemic perfusion, improving coronary flow, and lowering myocardial oxygen demand. See Figure 1. The Impella device line includes various models—such as the Impella 2.5, CP, 5.0, and 5.5—each offering different levels of support. Maximum flow rates range from 2.5 L/min with the Impella 2.5 to 5.5 L/min with the Impella 5.5, providing flexibility in circulatory support based on patient needs (Zein et al., 2022). Toronto General Hospital frequently uses Impella CP and I have taken care of many patients with this device. It provides up to 3.7 L/min of cardiac output support. It is inserted via a 14 Fr sheath through the femoral artery, following a retrograde approach into the ascending aorta, across the aortic valve, and into the left ventricle, guided by fluoroscopy or echocardiography. While the femoral approach is common, it is unsuitable for patients with severe peripheral arterial disease (PAD) or for those needing extended support that would require prolonged immobilization. Common complications arising with Impella use are vascular complications, bleeding, renal injury and hemolysis (Zein et al., 2022). The DanGer Shock trial, published in The New England Journal of Medicine by Moller et al. (2024) evaluated the Impella CP pump for patients with STEMI-induced cardiogenic shock. The trial found a 12.7% improvement in 180-day survival with Impella CP compared to standard care, but this benefit came with increased risks, including bleeding, limb ischemia, and renal complications. The findings suggest that Impella CP can enhance survival for high-risk patients but should be used selectively, balancing survival benefits with the risk of adverse events. This is the only positive randomized trial for MCS support in cardiogenic shock.

Due to the nature of this device, it is also used very frequently with VA ECMO for LV unloading, nicknamed ECPELLA. The use of ECPELLA has been observed to lower PCWP, enhance pulmonary flow by reducing right ventricular afterload, and decrease left ventricular (LV) dimensions. However, no randomized trials support this use for LV unloading. In a registry study of 510 matched patients, ECPELLA showed a 21% reduction in 30-day mortality compared to VA-ECMO alone but was linked to higher risks of severe bleeding (38.4% vs. 17.9%) and hemolysis (33.6% vs. 22.4%). These findings suggest a mortality benefit but highlight the trade-off with increased bleeding and limb ischemia risks (Ezad et al., 2023). &#160;

The case study I mentioned earlier by Jain et al. (2022) utilized Impella CP in a 40 year old in cardiogenic shock to unload the LV while the patient was on VA ECMO. They were able to successfully wean the patient from VA ECMO on day 5, followed by gradual weaning from the Impella on day 17, and discharged from the hospital on day 30, off all inotropic and mechanical circulatory support. I have had similar experience where a 30-year-old female in fulminant myocarditis with an EF of 10% was urgently placed on VA ECMO and Impella CP was needed for LV unloading. Pt ended up doing relatively well but did suffer from aforementioned complications prolonging hospital stay.

&#160;

One thing to note is that if a patient is only on Impella, that does not mean patient is fully supported like VA ECMO. If a patient were to arrest, CPR is still indicated as it only provides left sided support.

I could continue discussing other mechanical circulatory support devices, such as my favorite Protek Duo, a percutaneous right ventircular assist device, which I have assisted with insertion in the Cath lab for severe right ventricular failure from structural right heart procedure complications to temporize hemodynamic instability while a more definitive approach is being decided. It is a centrifugal pump with dual lumen cannula that comes in either 29 or 31 french that is inserted with single access via RIJ with outflow drainage from the right atrium and inflow into the pulmonary artery directly bypassing RV providing 4–4.5 L (L) of flow for the 29 Fr, and 4.5–5 L for the 31 Fr cannula (Brewer et al., 2024). See Figure 2 for a diagram of ProtekDuo. If the patient is also in ARDS, an oxygenator can also be added to this device providing both RV and Lung support. How cool is that! I will pause here for now.

### Response 7 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thank you all for the informative discussion on the different mechanical circulatory supports. The sharing of your experience is much appreciated.&#160;

Mechanical circulatory supports have really changed the game for people with severe heart and lung failure. These technologies have made a huge difference, helping many patients live longer and better lives. But it’s important to remember that while these devices offer great benefits, they also come with risks. Like everything else in medicine, it is all about balancing the amazing benefits and the potential downsides.

## Question

Question 5: Of all the monitoring devices you have learned in the course thus far, which can assist in determining a patient’s fluid status? Explain.
### Response 1 (Meera Sathananthan)

fluid status 101

It is important to understand the etiology of a patient’s hypotension or hypertension as it allows clinicians to appropriately respond and tailor their management to addressing the root cause rather than providing a series of band-aid fixes.

Decreased intravascular volume can lead to poor cardiac output as well as decreased perfusion to organs (1). In cases of hypotension due to low intravascular volume, the patient may have a refractory response to the administration of pressors as there is not enough volume to sustain higher pressures. Aggressive treatment of vasopressors in patients experiencing hypotension can also lead to peripheral vasoconstriction that may induce further reduction in perfusion to tissues, thereby increasing the risk of infarction.

Overloaded circulatory systems can lead to impaired gas-exchange due to pulmonary edema, as well as third spacing of fluid and organ dysfunction (1).

A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Two concepts in fluid summarized from Frank-Starling relationship: euvolemia and fluid responsiveness (1).
B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Frank-Starling relationship is the correlation between the length of the myocardial fibres and the force of cardiac contraction. Decreased preload results in less stretching of the myocardial fibres, decreased contraction of the ventricles, decreased stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO). &#160;There is a volume at which the strength of ventricular contraction plateaus; increasing preload beyond this point can lead to adverse effects, such as pulmonary edema, rather than improving CO (2).
C.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Euvolemia describes the state where the volume of fluid in the body allows for the myocardial fibers of the heart to be adequately stretched. In turn, this results in increased contractility, SV and CO. When a patient’s fluid status is described as euvolemic, there is no need to give or remove fluid (1). &#160;
D.&#160;&#160;&#160; Fluid responsiveness describes the state where the body benefits from fluid administration and will be able to improve its SV and CO. Overall, the administration of fluid results in more effective pumping and oxygen delivery to tissues and organs.
E.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Euvolemia is the goal of fluid resuscitation (1)

B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Neuraxial blocks, such as epidurals or other spinal anesthesia – most often seen in obstetrics and geriatrics
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; The sympathetic block leads to arterial dilation, resulting in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR). Also leads to venous pooling in lower extremities, decreasing venous return and CO (4)

-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Assessing the inferior vena cava (IVC) or internal jugular vein diameter and their respective collapsibility during inspiration can aid in estimating central venous pressure (CVP) and fluid status (Figure 2) (6, 8). Fluid challenges can then be performed, and the IVC can be reassessed to visualize response.

Invasive monitoring
Arterial line
A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Waveform basics (Figure 3)

Figure 3: Arterial pressure waveform components (lower waveform) and its relation to the cardiac cycle (upper waveform); 1 – systolic upstroke; 2 – systolic peak pressure; 3 – systolic decline; 4 – dicrotic notch; 5 – diastolic runoff; 6 – end-diastolic pressure (9)
B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Respiratory variations and fluid responsiveness
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Three key metrics can be derived from the arterial pressure waveforms (Table 1):
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Systolic pressure variation (SPV) (Figure 4)

Figure 4: SPV. A positive pressure breath leads to decreased venous return, SV and, therefore, a lower SBP (10)
SPV can be observed on the arterial waveform as variations in the height of the SBP peaks during inspiration and expiration as seen in the figure above. Positive intrathoracic pressure leads to a reduced venous return. This has downstream effects of reducing left-sided heart stroke volume, resulting in a lower SBP (10).
&#160;
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Pulse pressure variation (PPV) and stroke volume variation (Figure 5)

Figure 5: PPV and SVV shown in tandem with respirations (lower waveform)(11).
PPV and SVV both reflect changes in left ventricular SV that are caused by mandatory breath cycles provided by ventilators (11). SVV utilizes pulse contour analysis, which is an algorithm that continuously analyzes the shape and characteristics of the arterial line waveform to predict changes in blood flow with each heartbeat. If a monitor does not have this setting, SVV can still be inferred by analyzing the overall variability of the arterial pressure waves. Similar to SPV, these metrics both rely on consistent ventilation settings and regular cardiac rhythms in order to provide accurate measures (10, 11).
&#160;
Each of these metrics—SPV, PPV, and SVV—can guide clinicians in making informed decisions about fluid resuscitation, particularly in surgical and critical care settings (Table 1).

Central venous pressure (CVP)
A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Basics (1)
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Measures pressure in the superior vena cava (SVC), infers right atrial pressures
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Widely used to measure intravascular volume
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Waveform: three positive waves (a, c, v) and two negative waves (x and y) (Figure 6) (10).
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; A-wave: atrial contraction against closed tricuspid valve
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; C-wave: tricuspid bulging as ventricle contracts
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; X-descent: atrial relaxation
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; V-wave: atrial filling
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Y-descent: atrial emptying
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CVP is measured at the leading edge of the c wave, in tandem with the point at which the QRS of the electrocardiogram (ECG) waveform peaks (Figure 6). It is best captured at end expiration, as this is when the respiratory system exerts the least pressure on the central and pulmonary vasculature (1)

Figure 6: CVP waveform (upper) and ECG waveform (lower). The waves a, c and v, the x and y descents and the two phases of the cardiac cycle, systole and diastole, are labeled (12).
B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fluid status and CVP
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Useful for fluid management in the extremes of fluid status – extremely hypovolemic or extremely hypervolemic (10).
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CVP &lt; 5mmHg – suggestive of fluid responsiveness. A fluid bolus may improve SV and CO
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CVP &gt; 16mmHg – suggests the CO will not improve with fluid administration
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Systolic pressure variation (SPV) and pulse pressure variation (PPV), measurements derived from arterial lines, are better at predicting fluid responsiveness than using extreme CVP values
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Excluding outliers, it is difficult to confirm hypovolemia with a single CVP value. CVP is more useful as a trending value with its corresponding evidence of organ perfusion and function: changes in blood pressure, urine output and CO (1).
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Standard approach: administer fluids to increase CVP by 2mmHg and observe if CO increases (1).
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Different individuals will have varying CVPs at euvolemia. Poor cardiac function can increase the CVP required for euvolemia (1).
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Can also measure central venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) – levels &gt;70% indicate sufficient cardiac output and perfusion (1).
PUlmonary artery catheters (PAC)
A.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Basics
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Measures right sided cardiac chamber filling pressures, measure CO and ScvO2, and assesses intracardiac shunts, valves and vascular resistance (13)
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Indirectly assesses left sided filling pressures, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP), when balloon on catheter is inflated in the main pulmonary artery (1)
B.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Fluid status and PAC
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; CO can be measured using thermodilution measurement – electronic analysis of a thermal wash-out curve of a fluid of known temperature detected at the point of injection and distally at a thermistor (1)
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Some PACs can measure CO continuously with an adjunct thermal filament and computation module (1)
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Can also assess right ventricular ejection fraction (REF) and right ventricular end-diastolic volume (RVEDV) – allowing for titration of not only fluids but also inotropes, vasopressors and other interventions.
Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) (1)
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Routinely used in long surgeries and other complex procedures, especially in patients with cardiac issues, in addition to cardiac cases.
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Contraindicated for patients with esophageal strictures or malformation
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Requires experienced users to adequately obtain and appropriately interpret imaging.
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Can measure superior vena cava (SVC) collapsibility.
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Volume expansion decreases SVC collapse, decreases SVV and increases cardiac index
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Provides visualization of ventricular volume.
-&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; If fluid challenging, can perform a series of echo views to visualize ventricular filling and correlate with CVP. If left ventricle is distended, can reduce ejection fraction, indicating little benefit from fluid administration.
&#160;

Conclusion

There are several methods to assess a patient&#39;s fluid status during surgery, each offering unique advantages based on the clinical context. Noninvasive monitoring techniques like POCUS are often preferred for their safety and versatility. Invasive methods, such as arterial lines, offer precise hemodynamic metrics, including SPV, PPV and SVV, which are especially useful in settings requiring accurate titration of fluids and readily accessible if an arterial line is present. CVP monitoring, though limited in assessing fluid responsiveness on its own, provides valuable insights when used in combination with clinical assessments and other hemodynamic markers. PACs and TEEs are typically reserved for high-risk patients or complex procedures, as they provide comprehensive hemodynamic data but require specialized skills for insertion and interpretation.
The choice of monitoring can also be influenced by the surgical site and its sterile field as it will limit the use of certain monitors intraoperatively. For example, during chest surgeries like rib fixation or cardiopulmonary bypass, using POCUS is not feasible because it would compromise the sterility of the surgical field. In these cases, other methods should be utilized, such as TEE or respiratory variation metrics on an arterial line. Therefore, it is critical to be aware of the various techniques and their limitations. Ultimately, the choice of monitoring depends on the clinical scenario, the invasiveness acceptable for the patient, and the monitoring capabilities available. Using a combination of these tools allows clinicians to tailor fluid management and optimize patient outcomes effectively.

### Response 3 (Deena Kurilsky)

Thank you, Meera! I really appreciate the detailed and comprehensive summary on fluid status management and how clearly you outlined concepts of euvolemia and fluid responsiveness, and the distinctions between non-invasive and invasive monitoring techniques.&#160;

&#160;

I’m curious if you or anyone in the class has experience with the FloTrac system for assessing and managing patient fluid status in your ICU or OR. We’ve just implemented it at Sinai in our ICU, and while I haven’t used it extensively yet, it seems valuable. What are your experiences if you have? Has it been a reliable monitor?

&#160;

From what I understand, the FloTrac system provides advanced hemodynamic monitoring by automatically calculating key parameters every 20 seconds using data from the arterial line. The information provided helps to identify hemodynamic instability and assess the need for fluid resuscitation to ensure adequate patient perfusion.&#160;

&#160;

The parameters that update every 20 seconds include:

Stroke Volume (SV)
Stroke Volume Variation (SVV)
Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)
Systemic Vascular Resistance (SVR)
Cardiac Output (CO)

### Response 4 (Meera Sathananthan)

Thank you, Deena, for your thoughtful reply!

I have seen the FloTrac in action in the OR at St. Mike&#39;s, though I haven’t had a chance to work with it in depth yet. It really does streamline capturing these key metrics and helps us respond faster to any big changes. I’ll make a point to take a closer look next time and maybe pick the anesthesiologist’s brain about its specifics.

I definitely agree it seems valuable, especially since it spares us from needing extra invasive devices for measuring cardiac output (CO). Adding it to an arterial line we’re already using could reduce infection risks and complications from more invasive monitors (1). In goal-directed therapy (GDT) especially, which Tenzing covers in her post, it could be a real asset for providing real-time information to optimize fluid resuscitation and maintain adequate perfusion.

Thanks again for sharing this device. I wonder if other people have closer experiences with its use? For those who are unfamiliar with the device, here is a video on its assembly and use (Figure 1):

### Response 5 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

What a great overview of the different invasive and non-invasive fluid status monitoring! Thanks, Meera!

All these different methods of monitoring highlight the significance of taking a comprehensive approach to monitoring. This is one of the reasons why the CAS Guidelines outline the use of 7 required monitors (pulse oximeter, BP monitoring, ECG, capnography, anesthetic gas monitor, neuromuscular blockade monitor, as well as tidal volume and airway pressure monitoring) for all types of anesthesia. &#160;Additional more invasive monitors (TEE, CVP, PA, etc.) could also be indicated based on the patient&#39;s history and surgical considerations. &#160;Obviously, we always have to weigh the risks against the benefits when considering these more invasive monitors.

As an anesthesia assistant, it is essential to put the whole picture together with regard to monitoring. We need to see if all the monitors are illustrating a similar picture. In addition to the arterial line, I like to look at capnography to monitor fluid balance. Capnography is definitely one of my favourites because the trending of the waveforms, the shape of each capnogram, and the end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) value can all help provide a more precise clinical picture of my patient. Regarding fluid balance, ETCO2 levels can reflect changes in cardiac output and perfusion. It usually decreases before blood pressure decreases. For example, during a shock with a drop in cardiac output, ETCO2 will significantly decrease because there is a decreased blood flow in the pulmonary artery, which affects the ventilation-perfusion ratio. When fluid resuscitation improves cardiac output, ETCO2 levels typically increase, indicating better perfusion.&#160;

### Response 6 (Shawn Page)

Hello,I liked how Phoebe stated - we need to put all the pieces together.&#160; When I am pushing fluids in the cardiac OR i.e. packed cells, and more specifically blood from the cellsaver, I look at the overall vitals of the pt especially the art line pressure.&#160; The main thing I use in determining if I am pushing fluids super fast is the CVP thats being captured by the swan catheter.&#160; If the pts pressure is low, but the CVP is normal, or high I will just allow the blood to drip in and we will look at starting an inotrop (or sometimes we ask the surgeon if we can try reverse Trendelenburg).&#160; One thing we do have to keep in mind if we are pushing cell saver blood into the pt rapidly is their coag status.&#160; If the pt is &quot;oozy&quot; per the surgeon, we do not want to be pushing in blood that is highly heparinized. So again, we will allow that blood to drip in.&#160; So in short - personally, I look at as many values as I can, but also look to the CVP are being a very valuable number.

## Question

Question 6: Provide the rationale and procedure for zeroing pressure monitoring lines.
### Response 1 (Dan Chen)

Rational Behind Zeroing:&#160;

Zeroing pressure monitoring lines is essential for accurate readings across various systems, including Central Venous Pressure (CVP) lines, Arterial Lines (art lines), and Pulmonary Artery Catheters (PACs). This process eliminates hydrostatic effects caused by the height of the fluid column relative to the transducer, ensuring that pressure readings reflect true physiological values rather than external influences. Regular zeroing enhances accuracy, particularly in operation room settings, allowing for timely interventions based on precise data (Rice et al., 2000). Additionally, it is vital for adapting to patient position changes; recalibrating the reference point after any position alterations maintains measurement accuracy. Proper zeroing also helps identify potential system malfunctions, such as air bubbles or clots, that could compromise accuracy. Ultimately, accurate pressure readings are critical for diagnosing and managing conditions like shock, heart failure, and intracranial hypertension, enabling clinicians to make informed decisions and improve patient outcomes (Zhou et al., 2023). &#160;

The effectiveness of the pressure monitoring system can be influenced by the position where the zeroing occurs. The transducer must be aligned according to the patient&#39;s position to minimize the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the readings (Summerfield, 2019). The phlebostatic axis is located at the intersection of two imaginary lines: one along the fourth intercostal space and another from the axilla, midway between the anterior and posterior chest walls. This point approximates the level of the right atrium, where venous pressure is accurately measured. In the operating room, the transducer for pressure monitoring should be placed on a pole or stand at the level of the phlebostatic axis (Nguyen &amp; Bora, 2023). Sometimes, it can also be placed around the patient’s arm using a Velcro band while the patient is lying supine. Whenever the patient&#39;s position is altered, the height of the transducer should be adjusted accordingly (Summerfield, 2019). Any misalignment can lead to inaccurate pressure readings, potentially affecting patient management adversely (Nguyen &amp; Bora, 2023).&#160;

Zeroing the pressure monitoring line is vital because incorrect transducer positioning can yield false pressure readings. For example, if the transducer is too low, it will report artificially high values; if too high, it will show falsely low readings. Such inaccuracies can lead to dangerous clinical decisions based on incorrect data (Nguyen &amp; Bora, 2023).&#160;

By following these procedures for zeroing pressure monitoring lines and ensuring proper transducer positioning, healthcare providers can maintain accurate arterial pressure monitoring, ultimately improving patient safety and care outcomes.&#160;

Procedure for Zeroing the Pressure Monitoring Line: (Nguyen &amp; Bora, 2023)

Close the Stopcock: Turn the stopcock off to the patient’s end of the tubing.&#160;

Open to Air: Remove the non-vented cap from the stopcock, opening the stopcock to air.&#160;

Removing the cap allows the monitor to use atmospheric pressure as a reference for zero.&#160;

Zero the Monitor: Push and release the zeroing button on the bedside monitor. Observe the digital reading until it displays a value of zero. Some monitors require that the zero knob be turned and adjusted manually. Some systems also may require calibration. Refer to the manufacturer’s guidelines for specific information.&#160;

Zeroing negates the effects of atmospheric pressure.&#160;

Replace the Cap: Place a new, sterile, non-vented cap on the stopcock.&#160;

Reopen the Stopcock: Turn the stopcock so it is open to the transducer.&#160;

Turning the stopcock permits pressure monitoring and maintains catheter patency.&#160;

Activate Alarms: Ensure that the hemodynamic pressure monitoring alarms are active.&#160;

### Response 2 (Laryssa Hartmann)

Hi Dan,

&#160;

I really enjoyed your comprehensive overview of the zeroing process for pressure monitoring lines! I’m curious: how often do you think healthcare teams should perform zeroing, especially in high-stakes environments like the OR? From my experience, if the Artline transducer isn’t zeroed after repositioning a patient, the readings can be inaccurate, potentially leading to decisions based on faulty data. To prevent this, our anesthesia team emphasizes clear communication and ensures someone zeroes the Artline after repositioning patients, particularly during lengthy cases. Have you encountered anything similar in your experience?

### Response 3 (Dan Chen)

Hi Laryssa,

I&#39;m glad you found the thread helpful! You are right, zeroing should be performed at regular intervals in between procedures. I was just with an anesthetist in the Sickkids OR today, she told me that during surgeries that requires repositioning, zeroing is not necessary as long as the transducer is repositioned accordingly with the patient&#39;s position.&#160;

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Hi Dan,

I concur entirely with your point about the necessity of precise setup. Hemodynamic monitoring is valuable only when it delivers accurate readings.

Thank you for reminding us that the transducer must be at the level of the heart. At Toronto General Hospital, we can attach the transducer to the ether screen, a metal frame mounted onto the head of the surgical bed. In this way, the transducer will move along with the patient in bed, whether moving the bed up and down, or changing it to Trendelenburg or reverse Trendelenburg position.

To add to your point about systemic problems with air bubbles or clots. They can potentially overdamp the pressure-transducer system, underestimating systolic blood pressure and overestimating diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, it is important to prime the lines properly&#160; and to ensure that the pressure bag around the saline bag is pressurized to 300 mmHg. This would provide a continual flow of 2-3 mL/hour of normal saline flush to be delivered through the catheter, thus preventing blood from backing up the line, maintaining catheter patency, and minimizing clot formation.&#160;

Continuing on reliability, I would also intermittently cycle my non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) cuff to check the correlation with the arterial line. &#160;So, even if my patient has an arterial line, I would always put an NIBP cuff on the patient (usually on the opposite arm). &#160;This would assist in identifying any malfunctions of the arterial line and also act as a backup for monitoring while I troubleshoot the arterial line.

### Response 5 (Paula Watkis)

Hello Dan, Laryssa and Phoebe,

This is a very detailed and precise overview of pressure monitoring lines Dan. It creates an engaging atmosphere and makes the topic more interesting. I agree with all of your points, however both Laryssa and Phoebe also contributed great points as well. I can appreciate both points regarding zeroing after repositioning as well as the strategy of attaching the transducer to the metal frame and mount it on the bed. I don&#39;t necessarily think we should have any inaccuracies in the BP reading, whether it is done one way or the other, correct me if I am wrong. When checking for a correlation between your arterial pressure and&#160; the non invasive I was taught to place the cuff on the same arm, rather than the opposite as Phoebe mentioned. The reason for using the same arm is because the pressure and vascular resistance can vary between limbs which can create discrepancies in the readings. The placement and size of the cuff are also important factors to be considered as well.&#160;

### Response 6 (Gregori Kuran)

Hi everyone and thanks for the valuable back and forth dialogue. Reading through these posts regarding zeroing art lines and when they should and shouldn&#39;t be zeroed highlights the fact that there is definitely seems to variance and inconsistencies in practice. I have definitely seen a wide variance working at SickKids where some anesthesiologist will never put the non-invasive on the same side as the art line, some don&#39;t care if it&#39;s on the same side or not, as well as some that will first compare the non-invasive on both arms prior to deciding where they will place it. The one consistency that I can definitely say I&#39;ve seen and say is important is that they will always monitor a non-invasive BP concurrently with an art line reading and will cycle the non-invasive every 5 mins. Often these two readings correlate very closely, however when they don&#39;t it&#39;s important to pause and troubleshoot and assess the measurement prior to making any clinical decisions. Interestingly enough I went back to the policies and procedures at my facility and there isn&#39;t clear guidance as to placing the non-invasive BP on the same side as the art-line, it does however highlight the importance of comparing the art line reading to a non-invasive BP after zeroing. I&#39;m curious if anyone else&#39;s facilities has specific policies regarding placing the non-invasive BP on the same side as the art line?

### Response 7 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Thanks, Greg and Paula, for pointing out that there is always some variance in practice. The key is understanding the rationale and consequences of our choices. We do not have policies dictating where to place the non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP) cuff, but we will definitely always have one on the patient. The usual practice is to put all continuing monitoring, such as arterial line and pulse oximeter, on the opposite side of the NIBP cuff. The bonus of placing the pulse oximeter and the arterial line on the same arm is always to ensure sufficient blood flow to the fingers to rule out arterial occlusion, which is a complication of the arterial line.

## Question

Question 7: Describe the various IV tubing sets used in fluid therapy in anesthesia (e.g., standard set, mini-drip, Y-set with and without pump, Buretrol). Contrast and compare them in terms of indications and important considerations during setup and fluid management.
### Response 1 (Janet Rozek)

**IV Tubing Type**

**Indications**

**Important Considerations**

Standard (Macro-Drip)

Routine primary infusions for adults

A macro-drip infusion set delivers 10, 15, or 20 drops per milliliter

Micro -Drip

IV tubing used in pediatric and neonatal care

micro-drip infusion set delivers 60 drops per milliliter

Y-Set

Also known as secondary IV administration set
Used to intermittently administer medication while the primary IV is also running

Secondary fluids should always be “piggybacked” into primary infusion lines

Buretrol

Used to administer fluids, allows ability to control fluids or give medications in specific amounts
Fluid volume limiter

often used for pediatric patients

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;(Ernstmeyer &amp; Christman, 2023)&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

&#160;

(Ernstmeyer &amp; Christman, 2023)

&#160;

I have posted some very basic information, I know most of us are able to prime IV tubing so I did not feel it necessary to review primary IV line setup.&#160;

I will mention other considerations that may be used in the operating room with fluid therapy.

Extension sets are often used with each IV start and line initiation
Fluid warming tubing is often used in longer cases, hypothermic patients or patients requiring blood transfusions.&#160;
Pressure bags are often used in the OR setting with IV lines to bolus fluids/blood products when needed
Specific microbore tubing is used in medication infusion pumps when needed

### Response 2 (Ryan Christopher Floro)

Hi Janet,

Thanks for putting together this quick overview!

I found it helpful as a starting point in reviewing IVs, infusions, and the different sets. As an RT, I often see these attached to patients but am not as familiar with how to set up, prime, or use the various types of tubing.

I also found the video you attached very helpful and found a few more videos that helped me understand better. I&#39;ll paste them below for others to reference as well:

### Response 3 (Gregori Kuran)

Hi Janet,&#160;

Thanks for the concise overview on IV tubing sets. Having worked with&#160;pediatric patients for many years I did want to provide some more commentary with buretrols specifically. We often use buretrols at Sickkids for our smallest patients and especially when certain high risk fluids are being infused such as Dextrose containing fluids (especially D10) or fluids with potassium etc. As many of these fluids come in larger 1 liters bags these can be particularly dangerous to our smallest patients should they get an accidental large volume bolus. Buretrols are great in helping to ensure patient safety by providing a great visual and physical control over the fluid volumes being delivered to these patients. However from my personal experience they need to be used with caution still as if they are not primed correctly they are particularly prone to leading to air in the line and a potential air embolism. Another risk with them is if the operator using them re-primes the buretrol and then forgets to re-clamp the bag leading to the buretrol. This situation can be especially dangerous as you “assume” you are safely administering said high risk fluids to a small pediatric patient but have accidentally by-passed the main safety feature of a buretrol. In some situations alternative volume limiting devices such as a syringe infusion pump that you have to manually draw from a larger fluid bag can be considered, these do however add an extra layer of complexity. Whichever solution you should choose to limit the chance of an accidental fluid bolus it is important to be familiar with the equipment you are using and be cognizant of the steps you are taking at all times.&#160;

### Response 4 (Shawn Page)

Hi All,

Gregori, thanks for sharing your experience with peads!

Another tubing we need to be aware of is blood tubing.&#160; Any abdominal, cardiac, vascular, and spine surgery I typically put a blood set flushed in the room for the start of the case.&#160; If I have a chance to see the anesthetist I will confirm if they want this or not.&#160; &#160;Some do, some don&#39;t.&#160; Also, If i see a case that more than an hour and a half I will try and ask if they would like blood tubing flushed or not. And ask about fluid warmer with the blood tubing, I find the shorter cases the anesthetists don&#39;t want the warmer set up..... although this can save&#160; a step if there is a mass transfusion protocol called.Another thing I will ask is if they want&#160; PCA compatable piece to attach at the end of the IV tubing between the hub of the IV

### Response 5 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Janet, thanks for the overview of the different IV tubing sets! &#160;

I want to clarify that the Y-Set is actually the blood administration set. It is like two tubing sets combined into one, with two spikes (hence the term Y-set) of the same length connecting to separate drip chambers and individual roller clamps controlling flow. The Y-set allows for seamless blood transfusion, where we can spike up a second blood bag but keep it clamped while transfusing the first bag. Some Y-sets have a flexible pump that allows manual pumping to speed up transfusion. Those without a pump are completely gravity-dependent. We have the Y-Sets with pumps in our operating rooms at the University Health Network.

The piggybacking you mentioned refers to the attachment of a separate secondary IV set, which is shorter without any injection ports or backcheck valves, and is often used to administer medication. It is attached to an injection port of the primary standard macro-drip set. Usually, a backcheck valve is located above the injection port on the primary set to prevent medication in the secondary set from flowing backward up into the primary tubing. For example, this piggyback setup is often used preoperatively when Vancomycin needs to be administered before surgery.

Also, thank you, Greg, for reminding us of the danger of air embolism. It is imperative to do proper priming to remove air bubbles in the IV tubing. First, I would squeeze out the extra air in the fluid bag right after spiking. I also find it helpful to invert and flick at the injection ports when priming the IV tubing because air can often be trapped in the injection ports. The pump chamber of the Y-set tubing is quite large, and it needs to be held upside down when priming to allow it to fill completely. Otherwise, a large hanging air pocket in the pump chamber may inadvertently reach the patient. Lastly, ensuring the drip chamber has the required fluid level is also important. Air can enter through drip chambers when there is not enough fluid. However, do not fill the drip chamber completely either because, in this way, you will not be able to see any drip drops, which are important in assessing the system&#39;s functionality.

# Question 8

[View Thread](https://michbrite.michener.ca/d2l/le/7298/discussions/threads/3290/View)

## Question

Question 8: Discuss the methods for rapidly administrating fluid or blood products. Discuss the flow rate limiting factors.
### Response 1 (Ryan Smith)

Most national transfusion guidelines describe the standard of care for blood product transfusion to be slow and carefully monitored, however clinical situations arise wherein rapid administration is necessitated.1,2 Indications for rapidly administering blood products or fluid include (not limited to):

hemorrhagic shock

massive bleeding from:

- trauma

- peri-operative blood loss

- obstetrical massive hemorrhage

In the aforementioned scenarios when hemodynamic stability is significantly compromised (example systolic blood pressure less than 80mmhg) a rapid fluid and blood delivery (RFBD) system may be indicated. An RFBD is capable of administering fluids and blood products much more quickly than free flow or pressure bag intravenous administration, for example the Smiths Level One rapid infuser at 650ml/minute.3 These devices also warm the blood or fluid to help prevent against hypothermia and subsequent acidosis.

Recall from the laminar flow equation that flow is proportional to the radius to the 4th exponent:

Q =  π P r 4

8 n l

Q

flow

P

pressure

r

radius

n

fluid viscosity

l

length

Thus resistance decreases four fold for every increase in radius by a factor of one. The predominant limiting factor for how quickly an in-compressible fluid moves through a tube is the radius. Translating that to clinical practice, the larger bore intravenous catheter (or interosseous catheter) the greater the flow capability. It therefore follows that infusing a fluid/blood product quickly requires the largest bore catheter attainable. The Ontario regional blood co-ordinating network recommends the following iv catheter choices for blood or blood product infusion:2

Figure 1.0 – Recommended IV access, from ORBCN 20222

For adults a 16 or 18 gauge intravenous catheter is recommended for rapid blood administration, for pediatrics 22-25gauge (or largest available to be obtained). Central venous catheters (CVC) can also be used, however a single shorter large bore CVC is preferred over a multi-lumen longer CVC as the resistance of the former is much lower.

RFBD systems typically employ proprietary tubing that has a large inner diameter and can withstand higher pressures. Crystalloids, collloids, packed red blood cells (PRBC) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) can be administered via an RFBD, however platelets and cryoprecipitate should not.4 The fluid or blood product is warmed to 38-42 degrees, typically with built-in mechanisms to capture air bubbles and pressure limits (300mmHg).

CAUTIONS:

It is recommended that medications not be co-infused with blood products simultaneously.1

Pressure in the infusion system (blood product bag, RFBD, infusion tubing) should not exceed 300mmHg as this can cause hemolysis and bag rupture.5

Consider a common RFBD system used in Ontario hospitals, Level 1 fast flow fluid warmer.

Level 1

Always read and be familiar with manufacturers guidelines

Obtain largest bore peripheral IV access possible, separate from any medication infusion sites

Prime the proprietary rapid infuser tubing per manufacturer&#39;s guidelines

Perform blood product infusion checklists per individual institution policy

Attach the tubing as close to the IV hub as possible (try never to use extension tubing that is not rated for high pressure/high flow)

Open proximal then distal clamps in tubing and observe the tubing and patient for leaks and proper infusion at the site (watch for hematoma/interstitial fluid accumulation)

Pressurize the pressure chamber with the top lever, observing the adjacent pressure gauge

Carefully observe the site of infusion at the patient, watching for signs of displaced iv catheter and interstitial infusion

### Response 2 (Kelly Gram)

Great summary Ryan! As big of a pain the Level 1 can be, its one I would say most of us are quite familiar with. I just wanted to add another factor to flow limitation as it applies to massive hemorrhage protocols and that is the filter clogging. I&#39;ve been involved with running the level one in MHP situations many times. Typically after 8-10 units of PRBC we see the flow rate start to slow down, if not before. The filter itself (in the level 1) can be replaced but when dealing with massive hemorrhage, time is of the essence.&#160; One of the methods I found prolonged the filters life was flushing the circuit through with saline between blood bags. I got in the habit of having one bag of saline hanging in one pressure chamber and changed out the blood bags while running saline through the circuit until clear on the other side of the filter. Usually if the IV/central line was big enough, this process to flush the filter was very quick.&#160; Obviously there is still a life span for the filter but in my experience, this method significantly extended the filters life and allowed for a more efficient resuscitation.&#160;

### Response 3 (Minna Jin)

Hi Ryan,&#160;

&#160;

Great summary on the methods of rapid fluid administration and flow rate limiting factors. In addition to the rapid infuser and pressure bag, another common method of rapid fluid administration in the ICU is the intravenous (IV) pump. An IV pump is an electronic device that delivers fluids at controlled and adjustable rates. For fluid resuscitation, an IV pump can be programmed to deliver an IV bolus, such as Normal Saline or Ringer’s Lactate, at a maximum rate of 999 mL/hr.

&#160;

As you mentioned, central venous catheters (CVCs) can also be used for rapid fluid administration. CVCs are capable of delivering higher flow rates than most peripheral IVs. Additionally, CVCs with multiple lumens allow for the simultaneous administration of different fluids, medications, and blood products. This is crucial because patients requiring rapid fluid administration are typically hemodynamically unstable and need multiple medical regimens at the same time, such as antibiotics, blood products, and crystalloid fluids.

&#160;

On the other hand, while peripheral IVs are widely available, repeated or rapid administration of fluids—especially hypertonic solutions or blood products—can irritate peripheral veins. Therefore, they are not ideal in situations requiring sustained, high-volume fluid resuscitation or the administration of blood products.

### Response 4 (Phoebe Lam)

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Ryan, excellent overview on the Level-1 to kick start our discussion on how to give fluids rapidly.&#160;

There are various ways you can rapidly administer fluid or blood. &#160;The simplest way I have used is to manually squeeze the pressure pump on a standard Y-type blood tubing. A variation is adding a pressure bag around the fluid bag and pressuring it to 300 mmHg. You can use these two methods with a regular fluid warmer (e.g., Ranger). However, to give fluid more rapidly will require rapid infusers such as the Level-1 or Belmont Rapid Infuser, as Ryan explained. We always need to be aware of the risk of hypothermia when rapidly administering a large amount of fluid. With just an infusion of 500 mL of cold fluid, body temperature can decrease by 0.5-1.0 &#176;C. One exception is in the event of a malignant hyperthermia crisis, where rapid administration of cold fluids rather than warmed fluids is recommended as part of the treatment protocol. &#160;

Another reason to warm our fluids is that viscosity and flow rate share an inverse relationship, as shown in the flow equation in Ryan’s post. The more viscous a fluid is, the slower the flow rate. Viscosity can be influenced by hematocrit and temperature. The hematocrit content increases the viscosity of blood. Obviously, cold fluids also have a higher viscosity. Warming blood not only prevents hypothermia but also increases the flow rate. &#160;

In addition to equipment factors, don’t forget about patient factors as well. We should consider the location of the catheter insertion. For example, we need to consider whether it is against a valve or there is a chance of catheter kinking with the elbow flexion. &#160;Are there any other patient factors you can think of?

## Question

Question 9: You are starting an IV on a 5-year-old boy in the preoperative holding area. What equipment will you need, and what is the procedure for insertion? Be sure to discuss catheter sizes, lengths, and infection control precautions.
### Response 1 (Reneerose Ong)

**Peripheral intravenous (IV) Lines**: Indwelling, single-lumen plastic catheter inserted into a peripheral vein for fluid, medication, and blood product administration (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

**Uses and Benefits**: (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

Fluids, medication and blood products bypasses absorption barriers, delivering therapy directly to the cardiovascular system for rapid effect
Remains functional for several days, reducing the need for repeated needle insertions
Commonly used for phlebotomy at the time of insertion

****

(Kaplan et al., 2019

**Equipment **

**IV Line Components**:

**Catheter**: Hollow plastic tube with a hub above the skin (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)
**Needle**: Laser-sharpened with a &quot;flashback&quot; chamber for blood flow confirmation (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)
**Hub**: Color-coded by gauge (14G-24G), with a Luer lock connector for attachments (e.g., needleless cap, IV set) (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

**Size**: The higher the gauge the narrower the catheter (Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

Common pediatric IV access: 24G or 22G cannula in dorsal vein of hand

**24G Cannula**:

Standard for neonates and small infants
Prone to kinking in older children post-op due to movement

**22G Cannula**:

Preferred in pediatric patients and for use in the operating room i.e. 5-year-old
Narrowest catheter used in adults (Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

**Length**: catheter length varies with different manufacture

Standard length (3-6 cm) is used in majority of cases

Inserted in veins of upper limb, at or below antecubital fossa (AC)
Reliable for 3-5 days

Specific “long” (6- 15 cm) catheters may be used depending on the duration of IV therapy, vessel size and insertion depth i.e. long can be used in upper arm IV inserted under ultrasound guidance for prolonged use in those with difficult access &#160;

Inserted above AC, but no further than mid upper arm
Reliable &gt; 1 week

&#160;

**Safety Lines**: (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

Designed to prevent needlestick injuries
Incorporate mechanism (active vs passive) that cover sharp end of needle after withdrawing it from the hub of the canula

**Active**: User activates needle cover - user pushes button that pulls needle into plastic sheath
**Passive**: Automatic shield covers needle as soon as needle is withdrawn from hub

&#160;

**Additional equipment required**: (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

Tourniquet
Skin Antiseptics swabs or stick: alcohol or chlorohexidine
Gauze
Saline flush
Transparent moisture permeable dressing
Flushed Lure lock T connector or fused straight connector
Needleless connector cap (if using t-connector piece)
Board (for arm / hand or foot) especially for young pediatric patients
Tapes to secure board to patient

**&#160;**

**Local Anesthetic**: used with pediatric patients (i.e. 5 year old patient in scenario), administered by topical ointment (applied to skin ahead of time under a transparent dressing i.e. EMLA) or spray (Vapocoolant spray (Pain Ease) immediately before IV canulation) (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023; Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

**&#160;**

**Assistant: **&#160;Presence of an assistant (nurse, physician etc.) is essential for pediatric patients, in addition to utilizing parent or caregiver to participate in distraction and comforting the child. &#160;Child life therapist used if necessary (Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

**Role of Assistant**:

Essential for successful venipuncture in young children
Beneficial for anxious, distressed patients and assistance with patient positioning
Correctly hold hand and arm, distends veins, and prevents hand withdrawal of patient

**Technique**:

Gently retracts skin up the limb to stabilize the vein
Uses other hand to secure the child’s elbow, limiting sudden movement
Operator stabilizes their arm to counter child’s movement

**Positioning of awake child (**Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

Prepare tapes and equipment in advance for quick cannula fixation to prevent dislodgement once inserted

*Positioning techniques*:

Bed: Use blankets to hide and restrict the child’s hand (preferred)
Parent&#39;s lap: Child’s arm brought under parent’s arm to hide hand and limit movement
Use distraction (movies, music, games, toys and iPads) and assistant

&#160;

****

**&#160;**

(Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

**Procedure:**

**Timing &amp; Preparation**: (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

Insert IV close to procedure time to reduce dislodgement risk
Infection control precautions:&#160; Operator should perform hand hygiene, put on clean gloves, and have a sharps disposal box nearby
Clean site and remove any topical anesthetic ointment if used

**&#160;**

**Tourniquet &amp; Vein Access**: (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

Apply tourniquet 5-10 cm (dependent on child size) above site to engorge veins without blocking arterial flow
Inspect and palpate vein, clean with antiseptic (alcohol or chlorohexidine swabs or sticks) and allow site to dry, and administer local anesthesia spray if needed

**&#160;**

**Insertion Technique**: (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)

Hold cannula firmly (dominant hand with the forefinger and thumb on each side of the hub), apply distal traction and stabilize skin (with non dominant hand or hand of assistant), and insert needle with bevel up at &lt;30&#176; angle between catheter and the vein and parallel to the vein
Advance slowly until blood appears in &quot;flashback&quot; chamber.

If only a drop of blood is seen, the needle bevel may be partially outside the vein; flatten the line slightly and advance 1–2 mm until steady flow is seen

Separate catheter and needle and fully advance catheter into vein, until hub sits at the skin

**&#160;**

**Final Steps**:

Apply proximal pressure with non dominant hand (or done by assistant), withdraw and dispose of needle with dominant hand (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)
Connect IV set, collect blood samples if needed and release tourniquet (Kaplan et al., 2019)
Secure with transparent dressing
Flush with saline to confirm flow, ensuring no swelling at site
If an arm board is required ensure the site is visible and the limb is in an anatomical position (Hospital for sick children, 2021):

&#160;**For Hand Splinting**:

Have the child curl fingers around the arm board to maintain finger and thumb mobility

**For Elbow Splinting**:

Ensure sufficient board length above and below the elbow.

**Taping**:

Do not encircle the limb with tape to prevent circulation impairment

**Suggested Tape Placement**:

First tape: Across the site and around the arm board (without gauze).
Second tape: Just below the site, around the board (with gauze for patient comfort)
Third tape: Above the site, around the board (with gauze for patient comfort)

**Success Strategies for Difficult Cases**:

Tap or wipe skin over vein, apply warm compress, or adjust lighting and patient position (lowering arm below level of heart or opening and closing fists) (Beecham &amp; Tackling, 2023)
Feet are an alternative site for IV in pediatric patients (Sims &amp; Farrell, 2020)

Foot IV is more painful than hand but may be left post-op, depending on child’s age, stay length, and ambulation needs

Transillumination (i.e. Vein finder) and ultrasound (Kaplan et al., 2019)

Use of ultrasound guidance increases the success rate and decreases number of attempts necessary for successful cannulation in both adults and pediatrics
Devices to transilluminate veins to increase their visibility (often used in neonates) – may not improve first-attempt success

### Response 2 (Dan Chen)

Hi Renee,&#160;

Thank you for this comprehensive post on peripheral IV lines, I found the visuals you included very helpful in understanding this topic.

I’d like to emphasize the importance of positioning techniques to enhance compliance, especially in pediatric patients. Minimizing stress and anxiety during the procedure is crucial. Utilizing distraction techniques, as you mentioned, along with the involvement of parents or caregivers, can significantly improve the experience for both the child and the healthcare provider.

In my work in the pediatric ED, we often incorporate volunteers or child life specialists during IV insertions. They provide various distractions, such as plush dolls or Play-Doh. In my experience, one of the most effective distractions is playing YouTube videos on an iPad. Additionally, maintaining a quiet environment and limiting the number of people in the room can also contribute to a more positive experience.

### Response 3 (Kelly Gram)

Your post was excellent, very relevant and reader friendly with all of the visuals, and I will definitely review this again before my pediatric rotation.&#160;

My response is purely anecdotal and related to my experience at sick kids with my own daughter.&#160; She was having an MRI and required an IV for it. The entire experience was so well done.&#160; She is very phobic of any needles and between the freezing, distractions, warm blankets and excessive amounts of juice they offered her while waiting, not to mention the skill of the nurse, she didn&#39;t shed a single tear. They had music playing, she got to choose a video to watch during the IV and they froze her in multiple spots to ensure a backup plan. And I thought the unlimited juice boxes were genius. Thankfully it wasn&#39;t a situation where fasting was required, so perhaps not as applicable in the OR setting.&#160;

I think we could use a lot of these practices to improve even adult IV experiences. In my experience, there are a significant amount of adult patients that are terrified of IV insertions. Simple things like topical freezing sprays that don&#39;t need time to work (so it doesn&#39;t delay the pre-op process), warm blankets and distractions would possibly make patient experiences better. It may take a little more effort but overall a worthy endeavor.&#160;

Hi Kelly,

Thanks for sharing your personal experience.

Your story about the excessive amounts of juice reminds me that some anesthesiologists like to use Midazolam-spiked apple juice to sedate pediatric patients. Did your daughter have pure juice or the spiked ones that time?

I also worked with an anesthesiologist who likes to use lollipops. We quickly inserted the IV while the patient was sucking the lollipop. It actually worked very well that time. &#160;This is similar to the method used in IV insertion in neonates. I heard that the trick is using sucrose with a pacifier.

## Phoebe Lam's Response

Hi Renee,

Thanks for such an in-depth discussion on IV insertion in pediatrics. It goes hand in hand with Greg’s discussion on IV insertion in adults in Question 10. I believe the main differences between these two populations lie in patient communication, numbing the insertion site, and distraction techniques. &#160;I think these considerations could apply to developmentally delayed patients as well.

Working at UHN, I do not have much personal experience with the pediatric population. For local freezing, I only have experience with ELMA cream, which has such a slow onset. In your discussion, you mentioned Vapocoolant spray, too. I am curious to know which one is used more often. Which is more effective?&#160;

Regarding distraction, I think parents can be an asset in helping out, but sometimes, they can also be the problem itself. I have seen worried parents causing more agitation for the kids. Adding to Dan’s point on YouTube videos, I heard, in my other hat as a simulation educator, that there are projects incorporating virtual reality (VR) to decrease preoperative anxiety in the pediatric population. It provides another way for the patients to familiarize themselves with the surgical procedures and equipment. Perhaps VR, if not already, will be another distraction technique in the future.

### Response 6 (Janet Rozek)

Great review of pediatric IV insertion tips and tricks,&#160; I am really enjoying reading everyone&#39;s personal experiences and tricks of the trade. These patients are often the most challenging !

Throughout my experience in NICU and pediatrics, there are a few differences I find important when I am initiating access that is different to adult IV insertion.

neonates range in birthweight, so often very small babies either have extremely small veins that can be hard to cannulate or difficult to visualize, especially if they are compromised at birth
Most common sites for neonates are dorsum of the hands, saphenous veins or dorsal veins on the feet
important techniques for success involve proper bunding of child with an assistant to restrain neonate from moving ( they can be so strong and mighty)
sucrose and soothers are helpful to soothe the painful stimulus
shallow insertion angle is so important because you can easily go directly through a vein
Vein finders are often used in NICU to help with visualization

Most of my experience with pediatric IV insertion has been in the operating room where we use inhalation gases, sometimes just nitrous or nitrous and sevo.&#160; Some kids surprise me and say yes to the &quot; butterfly needle&quot;!&#160; Pre-op day surgery will put on EMLA cream on pediatric patients before the OR on both hands with cute little stickers to help make the process more timely for the team.

I haven&#39;t used that spray before, sounds glorious!

### Response 7 (Reneerose Ong)

Hi Phoebe,

When time allows, EMLA cream is often preferred because it’s more effective. However, vapocoolant spray is a great option when time is limited, as it works quickly by cooling the skin and reducing pain.

You’re absolutely right—distraction can be incredibly helpful for pediatric IV insertions. Regarding the use of virtual reality (VR) for distraction, there was a study conducted at SickKids that explored this approach in the ER. The research demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of using VR to reduce procedural pain during IV insertions!

### Response 8 (Janelyne Mandegarian)

Great work Reneerose and liked the contribution to this thread!

Just wanted to add that most children are very cautious on approach with health care providers so talking to them and explaining the steps goes a long way. Especially if they have not had an IV prior and the fear of the unknown is what makes it difficult. Children who are stable should be given extra time to build rapport with them, it&#39;s important for gaining their trust and the families, the apprehension and fear eases. I normally let the child play with the torniquet and show them the saline lock and first demonstrate on a family member or their stuffed animal, emphasizing that their is a little pinch like a mosquito but they will feel better and then there is a reward either popsicle, phone time or what ever the caregiver provides. If the child wants to take part with the practice I will let them and if they let me I will place the tourniquet on them to show them how it feels and landmark then. If the hand has the best site(s) then a layer of EMLA is applied and secured with tegaderm over it. Leaving it for 30 mins usually. Two nurses are normally needed, one to insert IV, one to help restrain the child and possible third to help with bloodwork and sending samples asap and the parent who ever can tolerate this process best to distract the child. We typically &quot;bunny wrap&quot; them in ER and have the other caregiver(s)/family members &quot;go for a walk&quot; basically to leave the room for their own sake, the less people in the room the better for stimuli.&#160; &#160;Sucrose was stated before and wow that is a lifesaver for neonates and toddlers who use a pacifier, the sucrose come in minuns and we squirt into the side of their cheeks and quickly put their pacifier back in their mouth.&#160;

### Response 9 (Gregori Kuran)

Hi Renee,&#160;

Thanks for the very detailed post on PIV insertions on pediatric patients. To further add to the EMLA cream versus Vapocoolant spray discussion I have to agree with Renee that our preferred method at SickKids is definitely to use the EMLA cream or some other form of lidocaine cream when time permits. However we don’t always have the luxury of applying the EMLA cream and having enough time for it to work effectively. In those situations our next go to of using the Vapocoolant spray also proves to be very effective for most patients. While this may be annedoctal the one issue I have sometimes noticed with the Vapocoolant is that during its application it can make veins that are difficult to visualize even more difficult as the cold “hides” the veins. In these situations I have to sometimes make a judgement call and potentially avoid using the Vapocoolant spray if I feel it may affect my success rate of canulation on the first attempt. Having to poke a pediatric patient multiple can quickly break their trust and be very traumatic for both them and the parents.&#160;

### Response 10 (Kelly Gram)

Phoebe,&#160;

Spiked apple juice is genius.&#160; She didn&#39;t have that but I can definitely see the value in it.&#160;&#160;

I do have experience with neonates and they do use sucrose and it works wonders on them. Babies who take pacifiers can take it on a pacifier but even the new babies just get a couple of drops sublingually and it works incredibly fast!&#160; If only sugar worked the same way on kids!&#160; Mind you the lollipop distraction trick is great too, is it considered a clear fluid and safe to use preop?&#160; I have worked only a couple of days with paeds in my current position and distraction truly is the name of the game....stickers and the mask flavouring stuff.&#160; All of the kids I&#39;ve worked with get gassed down for their IVs though so its much easier.&#160;&#160;
