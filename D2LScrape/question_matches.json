This occurs because of the narrowing of the vascular tree, which results in different impedance and harmonic resonances compared with the larger arteries. This amplification manifests in higher systolic but lower diastolic blood pressure readings, widened pulse pressure, steeper systolic upstroke, and a later occurrence of the dicrotic notch. Mean arterial pressure is slightly lower in a peripheral artery compared to the aorta.\nEhrenwerth et al., Chapter 12."

      "explanation": "Because of the risk of undetected intravenous or subarachnoid migration of the epidural catheter, additional test doses must be administered before a therapeutic dose is given through the catheter.\nAspiration of the catheter or needle to check for blood or cerebrospinal fluid is helpful if positive, but the incidence of false-negative aspirations is too high to rely on this technique alone.\nThe most common test dose for an epidural catheter typically includes 3 mL of 1.5% lidocaine with 1:200,000 (5 mcg/mL) Epinephrine.¬†\nIntravascular injection of this dose of Epinephrine typically produces an average heart rate increase of 30 beats/minute between 20 and 40 seconds after the injection. Heart rate increases may not be as evident in some patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers. In beta-blocked patients, a systolic blood pressure increase of greater than 20 mmHg may be a more reliable indicator of intravascular injection.\nPardo, Chapter 17."

      "explanation": "Patient breathing circuit disconnections are the leading cause of critical incidents in anesthesia. The most common disconnection site is the Y-piece.¬†\nAll connections of the disposable anesthesia circuit must be tight and secure before checking for leaks in the high-pressure system. Pneumatic and electronic pressure monitors help diagnose disconnections. The effectiveness of these monitors depends on the disconnection site, pressure sensor location, threshold pressure alarm limit, inspiratory flow rate, and resistance of the disconnected breathing circuit.¬†\nDisconnections can be complete or partial and can be detected by capnography with a drop in CO2 level. Capnography is probably the best device for revealing patient disconnections. An oxygen analyzer can detect disconnections through a low oxygen level alarm, although there may be a delay depending on the oxygen percentage of the fresh gas flow.¬†\nPardo, Chapter 15."
