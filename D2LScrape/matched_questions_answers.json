Leaks can occur from improper seating of the plastic bellows, resulting in inadequate ventilation because some driving gas is vented into the atmosphere.\u00a0\nA hole in the bellows can lead to alveolar hyperventilation and possibly barotrauma when using high-pressure driving gas. The value of delivered oxygen may increase when the driving gas is 100% oxygen, but it also may decrease if it is composed of an air-oxygen mixture.\u00a0\nThe ventilator relief valve can cause problems as well. Hypoventilation occurs if the valve is leaky because the anesthetic gas is delivered to the scavenging system during the inspiratory phase instead of the patient. If the ventilator relief valve is stuck in the closed position, it can produce barotrauma.\nPardo, Chapter 15; Ehrenwerth et al., Chapter 6.\nQuestion 2 - Nov 26\nCarbon monoxide (CO) can be generated when volatile anesthetics are exposed to carbon dioxide absorbents that contain NaOH or KOH (e.g., soda lime) and have sometimes produced carboxyhemoglobin levels of 35%.\nFactors that are involved in the production of CO and formation of carboxyhemoglobin include:\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0The specific volatile anesthetic used (desflurane > isoflurane > sevoflurane)\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0High concentrations of volatile anesthetic\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0High temperatures\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0Low fresh gas flows\u2022 \u00a0 \u00a0Dry soda lime\nWhenever you are uncertain as to the dryness of the CO2 absorber, especially when the fresh gas flow was not turned off on the anesthesia machine for an extended or indeterminate period, the CO2 absorber should be changed.\nPardo, Chapter 15.\nQuestion 3 - Nov 27\nPatient breathing circuit disconnections are the leading cause of critical incidents in anesthesia. The most common disconnection site is the Y-piece.\u00a0\nAll connections of the disposable anesthesia circuit must be tight and secure before checking for leaks in the high-pressure system. Pneumatic and electronic pressure monitors help diagnose disconnections. The effectiveness of these monitors depends on the disconnection site, pressure sensor location, threshold pressure alarm limit, inspiratory flow rate, and resistance of the disconnected breathing circuit.\u00a0\nDisconnections can be complete or partial and can be detected by capnography with a drop in CO2 level. Capnography is probably the best device for revealing patient disconnections. An oxygen analyzer can detect disconnections through a low oxygen level alarm, although there may be a delay depending on the oxygen percentage of the fresh gas flow.\u00a0\nPardo, Chapter 15.\nQuestion 4 - Nov 28\nThe two major causes of waste gas contamination in the operating room are equipment leaks and the anesthetic technique used. Regarding the anesthetic technique, the following factors cause operating room contamination: failure to turn off gas flow control valves at the end of anesthetic, turn on nitrous oxide and/or vaporizer when not connected to the patient, poorly fitting mask, use of high fresh gas flow, flushing of the circuit, filling anesthetic vaporizers, use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes, and use of Mapleson circuits which are difficult to scavenge.\u00a0\nPardo, Chapter 15; Ehrenwerth et al., Chapter 5.\nQuestion 5 - Nov 29\nAccording to the Canadian Anesthesiologists\u2019 Society guidelines, the recommended air exchange rate to minimize waste anesthetic gas concentrations in the operating room is a minimum rate of 20 air exchanges per hour. Moreover, exhaust air recirculation is not permitted during operational hours and is not recommended at any other time.\nThe air exchange rate helps dilute and remove waste gases that may escape into the operating room environment. This is essential to protect healthcare workers from the potential health effects of chronic exposure to these gases.\nCAS Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia 2024.Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia\u2014Revised Edition 2024opens in a new window/tab\nQuestion 6 - Nov 30\nDuring anesthetic with Sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, nitrogen should not be detected in the system. Any nitrogen in the circuit must come from the air surrounding the patient or the breathing circuit. Thus, the possible causes include venous air embolism and leaks in the breathing circuit or sampling line.\nFailure of the low oxygen pressure alarm will prevent us from detecting a loss in sufficient pipeline oxygen pressure. A failure in the inspiratory unidirectional valve will cause the patient to rebreathe expired gases containing CO2. However, if the breathing circuit has no leaks, it will not contain nitrogen.\nPardo, Chapter 15, Chapter 20.\nQuestion 7 - Dec 1\nFor end-tidal CO2 to be detected, there must be adequate pulmonary blood flow to deliver the CO2 to the lungs for excretion, ventilation, and an intact sampling system. Cardiac arrest will cease pulmonary blood flow. Extubation in a mechanically ventilated patient would result in cessation of ventilation. A disrupted sampling line in a sidestream sampling system would result in a sudden loss of CO2 waveform.

An oxygen analyzer can detect disconnections through a low oxygen level alarm, although there may be a delay depending on the oxygen percentage of the fresh gas flow.\u00a0\nPardo, Chapter 15.\nQuestion 4 - Nov 28\nThe two major causes of waste gas contamination in the operating room are equipment leaks and the anesthetic technique used. Regarding the anesthetic technique, the following factors cause operating room contamination: failure to turn off gas flow control valves at the end of anesthetic, turn on nitrous oxide and/or vaporizer when not connected to the patient, poorly fitting mask, use of high fresh gas flow, flushing of the circuit, filling anesthetic vaporizers, use of uncuffed endotracheal tubes, and use of Mapleson circuits which are difficult to scavenge.\u00a0\nPardo, Chapter 15; Ehrenwerth et al., Chapter 5.\nQuestion 5 - Nov 29\nAccording to the Canadian Anesthesiologists\u2019 Society guidelines, the recommended air exchange rate to minimize waste anesthetic gas concentrations in the operating room is a minimum rate of 20 air exchanges per hour. Moreover, exhaust air recirculation is not permitted during operational hours and is not recommended at any other time.\nThe air exchange rate helps dilute and remove waste gases that may escape into the operating room environment. This is essential to protect healthcare workers from the potential health effects of chronic exposure to these gases.\nCAS Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia 2024.Guidelines to the Practice of Anesthesia\u2014Revised Edition 2024opens in a new window/tab\nQuestion 6 - Nov 30\nDuring anesthetic with Sevoflurane and nitrous oxide, nitrogen should not be detected in the system. Any nitrogen in the circuit must come from the air surrounding the patient or the breathing circuit. Thus, the possible causes include venous air embolism and leaks in the breathing circuit or sampling line.\nFailure of the low oxygen pressure alarm will prevent us from detecting a loss in sufficient pipeline oxygen pressure. A failure in the inspiratory unidirectional valve will cause the patient to rebreathe expired gases containing CO2. However, if the breathing circuit has no leaks, it will not contain nitrogen.\nPardo, Chapter 15, Chapter 20.\nQuestion 7 - Dec 1\nFor end-tidal CO2 to be detected, there must be adequate pulmonary blood flow to deliver the CO2 to the lungs for excretion, ventilation, and an intact sampling system. Cardiac arrest will cease pulmonary blood flow. Extubation in a mechanically ventilated patient would result in cessation of ventilation. A disrupted sampling line in a sidestream sampling system would result in a sudden loss of CO2 waveform. Hyperventilation would result in a gradual lowering of end-tidal CO2, but not a sudden decrease.\nPardo, Chapter 20."}, {"week": "Week 12", "question": "poll\nThe structure MOST likely to be blocked during placement of an interscalene block in addition to the brachial plexus is the:\n10\nResults are hidden\nVertebral artery\nPhrenic nerve\nRecurrent laryngeal nerve\nVagus nerve\nSend\nVoting as \nAnonymous\nThe voting has been opened by the host\nAcceptable Use - Slido Privacy", "url": "https://app.sli.do/event/7kV8KzwqBeDEcqpRCYXNRw/embed/polls/eb447ca8-df54-4f3d-aff4-ee41709df6e4", "answer": "Week 12 Pop-Up Quiz Explanations\n\n\nQuestion 1 - Nov 18\nMany factors affect the sensory level after a subarachnoid spinal block injection.

Patient height also has little effect on sensory level.\u00a0\nPardo, Chapter 17.\u00a0\nQuestion 2 - Nov 19\nHypotension during spinal anesthesia is primarily caused by venodilation, leading to pooling and decreased cardiac output. It is also caused by decreased systemic vascular resistance resulting from arterial dilation. The amount of hypotension is related to the level of sympathectomy.\nAlthough the cephalad spread of a hyperbaric solution may be limited by placing the patient in a head-up position, this should not be done to treat existing hypotension because it will further decrease venous return.\nA decrease in blood pressure of 20 to 30% is usually well tolerated, but selected patients with cardiac, renal, or cerebrovascular disease may require treatment. Potential treatments include vasoconstrictors, fluid administration, and a modest head-down position.\nPardo, Chapter 17.\u00a0\nQuestion 3 - Nov 20\nThe structures that are traversed by a needle placed in the midline before the epidural space are as follows: skin, subcutaneous tissue, supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, and ligamentum flavum.

Heart rate increases may not be as evident in some patients taking beta-adrenergic blockers. In beta-blocked patients, a systolic blood pressure increase of greater than 20 mmHg may be a more reliable indicator of intravascular injection.\nPardo, Chapter 17.\u00a0\nQuestion 5 - Nov 22\nIntravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) is a peripheral nerve block in which local anesthetic is injected into the upper extremity distal to an occluding tourniquet. The tourniquet is inflated to about 300 mmHg or at least 100 mmHg above the patient\u2019s systolic blood pressure. The radial pulse must be tested for occlusion. This can be done by palpation or by placement of the pulse oximeter on the extremity.\nPostoperative analgesia is lost once the tourniquet is deflated and the local anesthetic diffuses from the nerves. Tourniquet times less than 60 to 90 minutes are used to prevent pain and nerve damage from the tourniquet.\u00a0\nLidocaine 0.5% at a dose of 1.5 to 3 mg/kg is the most commonly administered local anesthetic because of its relative safety and effectiveness.

Intracellular volume (ICV) constitutes 40% of total body weight, and extracellular volume (ECV) constitutes 20% of body weight.\nPardo, Chapter 24.\nQuestion 2 - Oct 29\nThe answer is true.\nSince 5% dextrose in water (D5W) is essentially free water, once the dextrose is metabolized, it is distributed throughout the entire body water compartments, both intracellular and extracellular fluids.\u00a0\nIn contrast, other crystalloids, such as normal saline, Ringer\u2019s Lactate, and Plasma-Lyte, are distributed primarily within the extracellular fluid, including intravascular and interstitial fluids.\nPardo, Chapter 24.\nQuestion 3 - Oct 30\nNormal saline is commonly used for initial fluid resuscitation in hypovolemic shock because it is isotonic and has the same osmolarity as blood plasma. This helps expand the intravascular volume without causing significant fluid shifts into or out of cells. It is also compatible with most medications and blood products, reducing the risk of adverse reactions when used in conjunction with other treatments. Lastly, it is widely available and relatively inexpensive compared to other fluids.\nPardo, Chapter 24.\nQuestion 4 - Oct 31\nFresh frozen plasma (FFP) contains all the clotting factors. It is used to treat patients with deficiencies in these factors, such as in cases of liver disease, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), or massive transfusion protocols.\nPardo, Chapter 25.\nQuestion 5 - Nov 1\nIn an emergency, when massive amounts of blood are immediately required and the supply of O-negative packed red blood cells (RBCs) in the blood bank is low, it is acceptable to transfuse O-positive RBCs into male patients or female patients past the age of childbirth before the patient\u2019s blood type is known.

Also, it suggests limited space for the tongue to be displaced during laryngoscopy.\nPardo, Chapter 16.\nQuestion 5 - Oct 25\nA bougie, also known as an intubation stylet, is a flexible device used to facilitate intubation in patients with a difficult airway. It is inserted into the trachea first, and then the endotracheal tube is advanced over it, helping guide the tube into the correct position.\nPardo, Chapter 16.\nQuestion 6 - Oct 26\nIf initial intubation attempts fail, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Difficult Airway Algorithm recommends reassessing the situation and considering alternative non-invasive techniques, such as using a video laryngoscope, fiberoptic bronchoscope, or supraglottic airway device. The goal is to secure the airway without immediately resorting to invasive procedures.\nPardo, Chapter 16.\nQuestion 7 - Oct 27\nIn a \u201cCannot Intubate, Cannot Ventilate\u201d situation, a supraglottic airway device is considered a potential intervention before proceeding to invasive airway access, like cricothyroidotomy.
